HMS Naiad 4 Dowling became executive officer on HMS Naiad when the ship was commissioned in 1940 Following service with the British Home Fleet the cruiser transferred to the Mediterranean Station in

returned to Australia and was appointed Director of Plans at the Navy Office in July 1942 1 In September the following year he was made Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff DCNS and raised to acting captain 2 6 his rank became substantive on 30 June 1944 4 As DCNS he was involved in planning the post war Navy s composition which for the first time was to include aircraft carriers 1 He defined the functions of maritime power in October 1943 as 12 i Maintenance of our lines of sea communications ii Destruction of the enemy s lines of sea communications iii Attack on the enemy s strategic positions in combined operations with Army and Air Force iv Defence of our bases In November 1944 Dowling was given command of the light cruiser HMAS Hobart which had been undergoing repair and refit

at the surrender of Japan in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945 Following the cessation of hostilities Hobart became flagship of HM Australian Squadron and Dowling flag captain and chief of staff to Commodore John Collins the squadron commander 1 21 The war had taken a toll on Dowling s health and he required leave before commencing his next appointment in May 1946 as Director of Ordnance Torpedoes and Mines at the Navy Office 1 2 Rear Admiral James Goldrick in the Australian Dictionary of Biography observed that Dowling was thrust into the highest positions of the RAN largely as a result of the heavy casualties of World War II When John Armstrong the only similarly qualified and more senior Navy captain was pronounced unfit for seagoing duty Dowling was given the chance to command Australia s first aircraft carrier HMAS Sydney commissioned in England on 16 December 1948 In April the following year two months after the ship s belated acceptance into service due to teething troubles Dowling embarked Sydney for Australia with two squadrons of fighters aboard 1 22 In June 1950 Dowling was promoted to commodore and appointed Second Naval Member and Chief of Naval Personnel serving in this capacity until the end of 1952 His term coincided with the outbreak of the Korean War and resultant increased demands on manpower 1 3 Dowling was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire CBE in the 1953 New Year Honours before travelling to London to attend the Imperial Defence College 3 23 Raised to rear admiral in July 1953 he returned home to take up the post of Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet that December serving through the following year He had to preside over cutbacks to operations brought on by government stringency after the Korean War 1 3 On 24 February 1955 Dowling succeeded Vice Admiral Sir John Collins as First Naval Member Australian Commonwealth Naval Board and Chief of Naval Staff CNS 24 He was promoted to vice admiral on 7 June and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath CB in the Queen s Birthday Honours two days later 25 26 On 15 June he joined fellow chiefs of staff Lieutenant General Henry Wells and Air Marshal John McCauley Prime Minister Robert Menzies and senior government members in approving a draft directive for the role of the Far East Strategic Reserve FESR this made Commonwealth forces available for the fight against communist insurgents in Malaya as well as for the security of Malaya and Singapore against external aggression 27 The Navy s contribution to the FESR was to be at least two destroyers or frigates on an ongoing basis as well as a yearly visit by an aircraft carrier The destroyers HMAS Arunta and HMAS Warramunga already in the region on an exercise were immediately committed and Dowling flew to Singapore to personally announce the plan and the reasons for it to the ships crews 28 Dowling was an early advocate for the establishment of an Australian submarine fleet in 1963 after several false starts the first of six Oberon class submarines was ordered 1 29 As part of a general Western trend that viewed with alarm the increasing capability of the Soviet Navy s surface fleet Dowling also worked to improve the offensive power of the Fleet Air Arm In March 1956 he went so far as proposing purchase of nuclear weaponry for the RAN s De Havilland Sea Venoms During much of Dowling s remaining time as CNS faced with the obsolescence of HMAS Sydney and in accordance with its two carrier policy the Navy tried unsuccessfully to acquire a new and larger aircraft carrier to augment HMAS Melbourne 30 Believing in the maintenance of traditionally close ties between the RAN and the Royal Navy he worked to coordinate his policies as CNS with those of Britain s First Sea Lord Earl Mountbatten 1 3 Taking into account the provisions of the ANZUS treaty and the absence of suitable supplies from Britain the RAN began to turn reluctantly towards the United States in terms of strategy and equipment 3 as Dowling explained to Mountbatten We now find ourselves at the crossroads because we very much doubt whether the United Kingdom can provide us with what we want in the future We have no wish to become Americans but there is a strong belief in this country that the sensible course of action for Australians is to acquire war equipment from the United States now Our very telling reason is of course that certainly in a global war our salvation in the Pacific will depend chiefly on the aid of that country For that we are not less loyal members of the Empire 31 Other issues facing the RAN during Dowling s term as CNS were its relegation since the beginning of the 1950s to third place behind the other armed forces in terms of Federal budget allocations its replacement by the RAAF as the country s first line of defence and a shortage of manpower Dowling himself considered separation from families lack of houses over employment high wages and overtime payment in civvie street as the causes for the Navy s inability to attract and retain personnel the Allison Report in 1958 led to improvements to service conditions which helped reduce wastage 32 The RANC had moved to Flinders Naval Depot in 1930 and Dowling was pleased to be able to oversee its return to Jervis Bay in 1958 the year before he relocated the office of the CNS to Canberra 1 33 Dowling was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire KBE in the 1957 New Year Honours 34 and completed his term as CNS on 23 February 1959 24 On 23 March he took over from Sir Henry Wells as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee COSC a role foreshadowing that of the Chief of the Defence Force 35 36 He was succeeded as CNS by Vice Admiral Henry Burrell 24 Happily surprised by his appointment as Chairman of COSC Dowling hoped to transform the position such that it would exercise command authority over the service chiefs but in this he was to be disappointed The position s rank remained the same as the heads of the Army Navy and Air Force and was only responsible for putting their views on military matters to the Minister for Defence 1 37 Other setbacks during his tenure included the Defence Department s decision rescinded after his term to disband the Fleet Air Arm and the Federal government s failure to back him when he announced at a SEATO press conference in March 1961 that Australia was prepared to intervene militarily in the second Laotian crisis if it became necessary 1 3 In September 1959 during the first Laotian crisis the Australian government had authorised Dowling to commit an infantry battalion a squadron of RAAF fighters air transport and two RAN destroyers to support US and SEATO forces but no intervention took place 38 Dowling retired from the military on 27 May 1961 and was succeeded as Chairman of COSC by Air Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger 35 39 Though keen to secure a diplomatic appointment nothing was offered to him and as a practising Anglican he instead busied himself with church affairs in Canberra In July 1962 the government gave him responsibility for organising Queen Elizabeth II s upcoming royal tour 1 In this role he was required to liaise with the state governments to plan the Queen s itinerary and to become a member of the royal household for the duration of the tour the first time an Australian tour planner had been given such close access to a visiting monarch 40 He was rewarded with appointment as a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order KCVO as of 27 March 1963 and became Australian Secretary to the Queen on 1 November the same year 41 42 Dowling was also the Australian Red Cross Society s Canberra chairman from 1962 to 1967 at the time he took over the chairmanship Lady Dowling was acting president of the organisation in the absence of Lady William Oliver 6 11 Roy Dowling died of a heart attack on 15 April 1969 in Canberra Hospital He was given a naval funeral at St John s Church and cremated His wife and five children survived him 1 43
