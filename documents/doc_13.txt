Bristol the largest city in South West England has an eclectic combination of architectural styles ranging from the medieval to 20th century brutalism and beyond During the mid 19th century Bristol Byzantine an architectural style unique to the city was developed and several examples have survived Buildings from most of the architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive intermingled with areas of more recent development Several Georgian era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class As the city grew it merged with its surrounding villages each with its own character and centre often clustered around a parish church The construction of the city s Floating Harbour taking in the wharves on the River Avon and Frome provided a focus for industrial development and the growth of the local transport infrastructure Key elements of which include the Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed Clifton Suspension Bridge and Temple Meads terminus the latter served from 2002 to 2009 as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum but is now closed 1 The 20th century saw further expansion of the city the growth of the University of Bristol and the arrival of the aircraft industry During World War II the city centre was extensively bombed in the Bristol Blitz The redevelopment of shopping centres office buildings and the harbourside continues to this day The city was defended in medieval times by Bristol Castle a Norman fortification built on the site of a wooden predecessor The castle played a key role in the civil wars that followed the death of Henry I Stephen of Blois reconnoitred Bristol in 1138 and claimed that the town was impregnable 2 After Stephen s capture in 1141 he was imprisoned in the castle 3 The castle was later taken into royal hands 4 and Henry III spent lavishly on it adding a barbican before the main west gate a gate tower and a magnificent hall 5 By the 16th century the castle had fallen into disuse but the city authorities had no control over royal property and so the castle became a refuge for lawbreakers In 1630 the city purchased the castle Oliver Cromwell ordered its destruction in 1656 6 An area outside the castle known as Old Market was used as a mustering point for troops It later became a market for the country people to set up stalls and sell their wares Old Market was also the site of an autumn fair 7 The market may have existed as early as the 12th century and was the site of the first suburb outside the city walls It had side roads which could accommodate the traffic on market days 8 The city had extensive walls built by Geoffrey de Montbray Bishop of Coutances These have now largely disappeared although parts remain on properties in King Street A gateway in the old wall can now be seen under the tower of the Church of St John the Baptist 9 The earliest surviving church in Bristol is St James Priory 10 in Horsefair Whitson Street It was founded in 1129 as a Benedictine priory by Robert Rufus The 12th century also saw the founding of All Saints 11 and St Philip and Jacob 12 churches 9 Temple Church now in ruins was built on the site of the oval church of the Knights Templar a Christian military order forcibly disbanded in 1312 Either just before or just after the disappearance of the Templars the church was rebuilt on a rectangular plan and served as a parish church 13 Bristol Cathedral 14 15 was founded as St Augustine s Abbey in 1140 by Robert Fitzharding along with its associated school with the building works continuing in the Gothic style until about 1420 St Mark s Church was built around 1220 16 Soon after the foundations were laid for Holy Trinity Church in Westbury on Trym 17 The 12th century also saw the foundation of St Mary Redcliffe 18 renowned as one of the finest examples of the 15th century Perpendicular style and the tallest building in the city Elizabeth I on a visit to the city in 1574 described it as the fairest goodliest and most famous parish church in England 19 These 12th century churches were followed in the 14th century by the construction of Church of St John the Baptist 20 and St Stephen s Church 21 Westbury College was a 13th century College of Priests located in Westbury on Trym A gatehouse now a National Trust property 22 was added in the 15th century The Tudor architectural period which lasted from the late 15th century into the early 17th century saw the development of large estates such as Ashton Court 23 They were built for the local merchants who gained much of their wealth from the trade passing through Bristol Harbour Red Lodge was constructed in 1580 for John Yonge as the lodge for a great house that once stood on the site of the present Colston Hall 24 In 1615 a number of houses were demolished for the development of the new Fishmarket 25 During the English Civil War the Royal Fort was considered the strongest part of Bristol s defences and it was to the fort that the Royalists retreated when they found themselves under siege from the Parliamentarians It fell to the parliamentary forces in 1645 and was subsequently demolished 26 St Nicholas s Almshouses were built in 1652 27 to provide care for the poor Several public houses were also built in this period including the Llandoger Trow 28 on King Street and the Hatchet Inn 29 More churches were built including St Michael on the Mount Without 30 It served the St Michaels hill area one of the first areas outside the city walls to be colonised by the wealthy merchants who were by then trying to escape the overcrowded and unhealthy conditions in the city centre 8 The city was by this time beginning to expand rapidly beyond its traditional city walls and the surrounding villages were starting to become suburbs such as the villages of Horfield and Brislington Both had their own churches the Church of the Holy Trinity with St Edmund 31 and St Lukes 32 respectively The Stuart or English Baroque period 1666 1713 saw more expansion of the city Large mansions such as Kings Weston House 33 and Goldney Hall 34 were constructed The needs of the poor and destitute became the responsibility of institutions such as Colstons 35 and the Merchant Venturers Almshouses 36 The King Street area was developed outside the Back Street Gate of the city home to the King William and Naval Volunteer Public Houses 37 The nearby Queen Square was planned during this era In 1669 a series of four flights of steps now called Christmas Steps was constructed to replace a steep muddy and narrow street formerly known as Queene Street 38 39 Many of the larger houses of this period including Queen Square were built for merchant families who were heavily involved in the slave triangle importing goods from slave plantations A few African and creole American Caribbean born slaves came to Bristol as servants 40 In 1732 John Strachan built Redland Court for John Cossins It now forms one of the buildings making up Redland High School for Girls 41 In 1760 the Bristol Bridge Act was carried through parliament by the Bristol MP Sir Jarrit Smyth 42 That led to the demolition of St Nicholas s Gate along with the original St Nicholas church part of the Old Shambles and thirty houses that stood on the old bridge 25 The original bridge was a medieval wooden structure lined with houses on both sides 8 A 17th century illustration shows that these were five stories high including the attic rooms and that they overhung the river much as Tudor houses would overhang the street 43 At the time of the Civil War the bridge was noted for its community of goldsmiths who may have been attracted by the unusually secure premises 43 The current St Nicholas church was rebuilt in 1762 9 by James Bridges and Thomas Paty who rebuilt the spire Part of the old church and town wall survives in the 14th century crypt 44 The 1766 Theatre Royal which claims to be the oldest continually operating theatre in England joined with the Coopers Hall from 1744 and designed by architect William Halfpenny to form the Bristol Old Vic 45 46 47 During the period of Georgian architecture about 1720 1840 the main architects and builders working in Bristol were James Bridges John Wallis and Thomas Paty with his sons John and William Paty 9 They put up hundreds of new buildings reflecting the increased prosperity that came with the new Floating Harbour and trade based at The Exchange built in 1741 43 by John Wood the Elder 48 49 50 Their early work included the Royal Fort 26 Blaise Castle House 51 and Arno s Court estate with the associated Arno s Court Triumphal Arch 52 and Black Castle Public House 53 More modest terraces and squares grew up in the new suburbs such as Hotwells 8 and north into Clifton including 7 Great George Street now the Georgian House Museum 54 It was built around 1790 for John Pinney a successful sugar merchant and is believed to be the house where the poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge first met 55 It was also home to Pinney s slave Pero after whom Pero s Bridge at Bristol Harbour is named 56 In addition to evidence of the wealth brought by the slave trade there are several significant links to the abolitionists Bristol s Hannah More was an influential member of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the African Slave Trade In the Seven Stars Public House Thomas Clarkson collected evidence for William Wilberforce on the cruelty of the trade in humans Bristol Cathedral contains several memorials to people active in the abolition cause including a bust of Robert Southey 57 John Wesley opposed the trade in humans and in 1774 his sermon at the New Room against slavery was disturbed by explosion Several plays adopted by the abolitionists were performed at the Bristol Old Vic including Oroonoko the story of an enslaved African and The Padlock which was praised by Clarkson for its importance to the abolition cause 58 Several residential squares with terraces of three storey houses were laid out around central gardens An example is Portland Square which was built between 1789 and 1820 and is now largely occupied by offices In the 1830s much of Queen Square was rebuilt following damage caused during the Bristol Riots 59 and to the north of the city Kings Square The most fashionable areas were at the top of the hill as in wet weather the cesspits overflowed down the hill 8 Further development though in a less formal manner continued along the radial roads to Stokes Croft and Cheltenham towards Horfield and in the St Phillips Redcliffe and Bedminster areas 8 Religious needs in the expanding city were met for several denominations with Redland Chapel 60 and other Church of England buildings appearing including Christ Church 61 and St Werburghs Whitefield s Tabernacle Kingswood was the first Methodist chapel 62 and a Quaker meeting house known as Quakers Friars was built in 1749 63 The term Regency architecture refers primarily to buildings of the early 19th century when George IV was still Prince Regent and also to later buildings of the Victorian period which were designed in the same style It follows closely on from the neo classical Georgian style of architecture adding an elegance and lightness of touch Many buildings in the Regency style have a white painted stucco facade and an entryway to the main front door usually coloured black framed by two columns Regency houses were typically built as terraces or crescents often in a setting of trees and shrubs 8 Elegant wrought iron balconies and bow windows were also fashionable An instigator of this style was John Nash whose most notable work in Bristol is Blaise Hamlet a complex of small cottages surrounding a green It was built around 1811 for the retired employees of Quaker banker and philanthropist John Scandrett Harford who owned Blaise Castle House The cottages are now owned by the National Trust 64 The Clifton and Cotham areas provide examples of the developments from the Georgian to the Regency style with many fine terraces and villas facing the road and at right angles to it In the early 19th century the romantic medieval gothic style appeared partially as a backlash to the symmetry of Palladianism and can be seen in buildings such as Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery 65 Royal West of England Academy 66 and The Victoria Rooms 67 St Mary on the Quay church was built between 1839 and 1843 by Richard Shackleton Pope as a Catholic apostolic chapel for the Irvingite congregation it is now a Roman Catholic church 68 The Victorian era saw further expansion of the city both in its industrial heartland around the docks and in the suburbs particularly in Clifton Palatial squares were developed for the prosperous middle classes Italianate and Grecian villas made with Bath Stone and sitting in their own gardens were built in areas such as Clifton Down At the same time hundreds of acres of working class and artisan homes were built especially in the south and east of the city 8 To support the growing population public service buildings such as the Beaufort Hospital now Glenside schools such as Clifton College and public houses such as the Mauretania Public House were constructed 69 Between 1849 and 1870 five large stone buildings were erected by George Müller to care for 2 050 orphans in his Ashley Down orphanage 70 Cabot Tower is situated in a public park on Brandon Hill It was built in 1897 by William Venn Gough in memory of John Cabot 400 years after he set sail from Bristol and landed on what is now Canada 71 A notable feature of Bristol s architecture is the Bristol Byzantine style 72 Characterised by complicated polychrome brick and decorative arches this style was used in the construction of factories warehouses and municipal buildings built in the Victorian era Surviving examples include the Colston Hall 73 the Granary on Welsh Back and the Gloucester Road Carriage Works 74 along with some of the buildings around Victoria Street Several of the warehouses around the harbour have also survived including the Arnolfini which now houses an art gallery 75 Clarks Wood Company warehouse 76 the St Vincent s Works 77 in Silverthorne Lane and the Wool Hall 78 in St Thomas Street are other survivors from the 19th century The local Pennant sandstone is frequently used as walling material often with limestone dressings as found on the old Temple Meads railway station 79 and Clifton Down railway station 80 Pennant sandstone is also used as large rock faced squared blocks described as Pennant rubble which are used alone eked out with plain brickwork or incorporated into the more rugged examples of Bristol Byzantine Much of the local transport infrastructure including the Clifton Suspension Bridge and the original Temple Meads railway station now used as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum were designed or built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel 81 In 1864 after over 100 years of planning the Clifton Suspension Bridge 82 over the Avon Gorge linked the city to the Ashton Court estate However development to the west of the River Avon remained limited Edward Everard s printing works with its detailed ceramic frontage was constructed in 1900 In the early part of the 20th century further expansion took place in residential districts increasingly distant from the city centre Bristol Hippodrome was designed by Frank Matcham and opened on 16 December 1912 83 The Wills Memorial Building was commissioned in 1912 by George Alfred Wills and Henry Herbert Wills the magnates of the Bristol tobacco company W D H O Wills in honour of their father Henry Overton Wills III benefactor and first Chancellor of the University of Bristol Sir George Oatley was chosen as architect and told to build to last He produced a design in the Perpendicular Gothic style to evoke the famous university buildings of Oxford and Cambridge 84 85 86 The university also took over several existing houses such as Royal Fort 26 Victoria Rooms 67 Clifton Hill House 87 Goldney Hall 34 Wills Hall 88 and buildings on Berkeley Square 89 90 91 Park Street and the surrounding areas Oatley was also involved in the design or restoration of other buildings in Bristol in the early part of the 20th century including the restoration of John Wesley s original Methodist chapel the New Room 92 93 The 1930s saw the construction of the Employment Exchange and the planning of the new Council House although this was not completed until 1956 94 As a centre of aircraft manufacturing Bristol was a target for bombing during the Bristol Blitz of World War II 95 Bristol s city centre was severely damaged especially in November and December 1940 when the Broadmead area was flattened and Hitler claimed to have destroyed the city 96 The original central area near the bridge and castle is now a park featuring two bombed out churches and fragments of the castle A third bombed church has been given a new lease of life as the St Nicholas Church Museum Slightly to the north the Broadmead shopping centre was built over bomb damaged areas Clifton Cathedral to the north of the city centre was built during the early 1970s Like much of British post war development the regeneration of Bristol city centre was characterised by Modernist architecture including Brutalist towers such as Castlemead one of several notable examples of brutalist architecture 97 in the city and improvement and expansion to road infrastructure The world s oldest shot tower in Redcliffe was lost to road development in 1968 being replaced the following year by the Cheese Lane Shot Tower on a different site Since the 1990s this trend has been reversing limiting access with the closure of a number of main roads whilst the Broadmead shopping centre has been further developed In 2006 one of the city centre s tallest Mid Century Modern towers was lost with further historic 20th century structures being destroyed more recently The transfer of the docks to Avonmouth 7 miles 11 km downstream from the city centre relieved congestion in the centre of Bristol and allowed substantial redevelopment of the old central dock area the Floating Harbour The continued existence of the central docks was for some time in jeopardy as they were seen to be remnants of a derelict industry instead of an asset to be developed for public use In the 1990s a harbourside concert hall designed by architects Behnisch Partners was planned but an Arts Council decision cut the funding and the project has not been revived 98 This has left We The Curious formerly At Bristol which mixes art science and nature with its all reflective planetarium as the centrepiece of the Harbourside development 99 The Broadmead shopping centre was redeveloped in the early years of the century involving the demolition of one the city s tallest mid century towers Tollgate House in the construction of Cabot Circus 100 The former Bristol and West Tower was reworked into a glass skyscraper with glass panels in place of its concrete outer cladding In 2005 the city council undertook extensive consultations about the future of tall buildings in Bristol and identified support for new tall buildings so long as they are well designed sustainable distinctive and fit into the existing urban landscape 101 In May 2007 proposals were announced to build approximately 753 000 square feet 70 000 m² net of homes offices and business premises in the St Pauls area The development if it had been approved would have included a 600 feet 183 m 40 storey tower next to the M32 motorway acting as a new entrance to the city The tower would have been a similar shape to the Swiss Re Gherkin tower in London 102 Planning for the large Finzels Reach development across the Floating Harbour from Castle Park including the old Georges Brewery buildings was first granted in 2006 but progress was hampered by the recession and the developers went into receivership 103 By 2015 the development is part complete with the historic waterfront facade still awaiting regeneration 104 Since 2013 Bristol has seen an increase in buildings being built or office blocks being converted for student accommodation These include Froomsgate House St Lawrence House a former office block in Broad Street the former Magistrates Court site and New Bridewell Tower 105 A roster of the tallest buildings constructed in Bristol includes 106 Coordinates 51
