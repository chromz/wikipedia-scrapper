Bodiam Castle ˈboʊdiəm is a 14th century moated castle near Robertsbridge in East Sussex England It was built in 1385 by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge a former knight of Edward III with the permission of Richard II ostensibly to defend the area against French invasion during the Hundred Years War Of quadrangular plan Bodiam Castle has no keep having its various chambers built around the outer defensive walls and inner courts Its corners and entrance are marked by towers and topped by crenellations Its structure details and situation in an artificial watery landscape indicate that display was an important aspect of the castle s design as well as defence It was the home of the Dalyngrigge family and the centre of the manor of Bodiam Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of Dalyngrigges until their line became extinct when the castle passed by marriage to the Lewknor family During the Wars of the Roses Sir Thomas Lewknor supported the House of Lancaster and when Richard III of the House of York became king in 1483 a force was despatched to besiege Bodiam Castle It is unrecorded whether the siege went ahead but it is thought that Bodiam was surrendered without much resistance The castle was confiscated but returned to the Lewknors when Henry VII of the House of Lancaster became king in 1485 Descendants of the Lewknors owned the castle until at least the 16th century By the start of the English Civil War in 1641 Bodiam Castle was in the possession of Lord Thanet He supported the Royalist cause and sold the castle to help pay fines levied against him by Parliament The castle was subsequently dismantled and was left as a picturesque ruin until its purchase by John Fuller in 1829 Under his auspices the castle was partially restored before being sold to George Cubitt 1st Baron Ashcombe and later to Lord Curzon both of whom undertook further restoration work The castle is protected as a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Monument It has been owned by The National Trust since 1925 donated by Lord Curzon on his death and is open to the public Edward Dalyngrigge was a younger son and thus deprived of his father s estates through the practice of primogeniture hence he had to make his own fortunes 1 By 1378 he owned the manor of Bodiam by marrying into a land owning family 2 From 1379 to 1388 Dalyngrigge was a Knight of the Shire for Sussex and one of the most influential people in the county 3 By the time he applied to the king for a licence to crenellate build a castle the Hundred Years War had been fought between England and France for nearly 50 years 4 Edward III of England reigned 1327 1377 pressed his claim for the French throne and secured the territories of Aquitaine and Calais Dalyngrigge was one of many Englishmen who travelled to France to seek their fortune as members of Free Companies groups of mercenaries who fought for the highest bidder He left for France in 1367 and journeyed with Lionel Duke of Clarence and son of Edward III After fighting under the Earl of Arundel Dalyngrigge joined the company of Sir Robert Knolles a notorious commander who was reputed to have made 100 000 gold crowns as a mercenary from pillage and plunder 5 It was as a member of the Free Companies that Dalyngrigge raised the money to build Bodiam Castle he returned to England in 1377 6 The Treaty of Bruges 1375 ensured peace for two years but after it expired fighting resumed between England and France 7 In 1377 Edward III was succeeded by Richard II During the war England and France struggled for control of the English Channel with raids on both coasts With the renewed hostilities Parliament voted that money should be spent on defending and fortifying England s south coast and defences were erected in Kent in anticipation of a French invasion 8 There was internal unrest as well as external threats and Dalyngrigge was involved in suppressing the Peasants Revolt of 1381 3 The manor of Bodiam was granted a charter in 1383 permitting a weekly market and an annual fair to be held 9 10 In 1385 a fleet of 1 200 ships variously cogs barges and galleys gathered across the English Channel at Sluys Flanders the population of southern England was in a state of panic Later in the year Edward Dalyngrigge was granted a licence to fortify his manor house 8 Know that of our special grace we have granted and given licence on behalf of ourselves and our heirs so far as in us lies to our beloved and faithful Edward Dalyngrigge Knight that he may strengthen with a wall of stone and lime and crenellate and may construct and make into a Castle his manor house of Bodiam near the sea in the County of Sussex for the defence of the adjacent country and the resistance to our enemies In witness of which etc The King at Westminster 20 October Dalyngrigge s licence from Richard II permitted him to refortify his existing manor house but instead he chose a fresh site to build a castle on Construction was completed in one phase and most of the castle is in the same architectural style Archaeologist David Thackray has deduced from this that Bodiam Castle was built quickly probably because of the threat from the French 12 Stone castles were usually time consuming and expensive to build often costing thousands of pounds 13 Dalyngrigge was Captain of the port of Brest in France from 1386 to 1387 and as a result was probably absent for the first years of the castle s construction 10 It replaced the old manor house as Dalyngrigge s main residence and the administrative centre of the manor 14 It is not recorded when Bodiam Castle was completed but Thackray suggests that it was before 1392 Dalyngrigge did not have long to spend in the completed castle as he was dead by 1395 10 Danlyngrigge s estates including the castle were inherited by his son John Dalyngrigge Like his father John enjoyed the favour of the king and was described as the King s Knight in 1400 he was granted an annual allowance of 100 marks by the king He died on 27 September 1408 leaving a will by which his property passed to his widow Alice during her lifetime Since they had no children at Alice s death which occurred in 1442 it was to pass to John s cousin Richard Dallingrigge son of Edward s brother Walter 15 Upon Richard s death without issue in 1470 his brother William having died before him he left the estates to Sir Roger Lewknor son of Richard s sister Phillippe Dallingridge Phillippe had married Sir Thomas Lewknor of Horsted Keynes before 1417 and died in 1421 Sir Thomas who made a second marriage died in 1452 16 By this means Bodiam Castle passed from the Dallingrigge into the Lewknor family 17 Sir Thomas Lewknor son of Sir Roger was a supporter of the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses which began in 1455 When Richard of the House of York ascended to the throne as Richard III in 1483 Lewknor was accused of treason and of raising men at arms in southeast England In November 1483 Lewknor s uncle and Thomas Howard the Earl of Surrey were given permission to levy men and besiege Bodiam Castle where Lewknor was based It is not recorded whether the siege went ahead and Thackray suggests that Lewknor surrendered without much resistance His property was confiscated and Nicholas Rigby was made constable of the castle On Henry VII s accession to the English throne the attainder was revoked and Bodiam Castle was returned to Lewknor However not all the surrounding land was returned to the family until 1542 Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of the Lewknor family Although the inheritance of the castle can be traced through the 16th and 17th centuries there is little to indicate how it was used in this period or if the family spent much time in it 18 Following the death of Sir Roger Lewknor in 1543 his estates were divided among his descendants and the castle and manor were split 19 John Levett of Salehurst purchased the castle in 1588 20 In 1623 most of the estates of Bodiam were bought by Sir Nicholas Tufton later Earl of Thanet His son John Tufton 2nd Earl of Thanet inherited Nicholas s property on his father s death in 1631 it was John Tufton who reunited possession of castle and manor when he bought Bodiam Castle in 1639 John Tufton was a supporter of the Royalist cause during the English Civil War and led an attack on Lewes and was involved in a Royalist defeat at Haywards Heath Parliament confiscated some of his lands in 1643 and more in 1644 as well as fining him 9 000 1 600 000 today 21 22 To help pay his fine Tufton sold Bodiam Castle for 6 000 1 040 000 today 21 in March 1644 to Nathaniel Powell a Parliamentarian 22 After the Civil War Powell was made a baronet by Charles II Although it is unrecorded when Bodiam Castle was dismantled slighted it was probably after it was bought by Powell During and after the Civil War many castles were slighted to prevent them from being reused Not all were destroyed completely and in some cases care was taken not to unnecessarily deface the structure At Bodiam it was deemed sufficient to dismantle the barbican the bridges and the buildings inside the castle When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675 Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son also called Nathaniel After the second Nathaniel the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow his daughter in law 23 In 1722 Sir Thomas Webster bought the castle For over a century Bodiam Castle and its associated manor descended through the Webster family It was in this period that the site became popular as an early kind of tourist attraction because of its connection with the medieval period The first drawings of Bodiam Castle date from the mid 18th century when it was depicted as a ruin overgrown with ivy 24 Ruins and medieval buildings such as Bodiam Castle served as an inspiration for the revival in Gothic architecture and the renovation of old structures 25 The third Sir Godfrey Webster began looking for buyers for the castle in 1815 and in 1829 he finally managed to sell it and 24 acres 10 ha of the surrounding land to John Mad Jack Fuller for 3 000 270 000 today 21 25 Fuller repaired one of the towers added new gates to the site and removed a cottage which had been built within the castle in the 18th century he is thought to have bought the castle to prevent the Webster family from dismantling it and reusing its materials George Cubitt later Baron Ashcombe purchased the castle and its 24 acres 9 7 ha from Fuller s grandson in 1849 for over 5 000 520 000 today 21 26 Cubitt continued the renovations that Fuller started He commissioned the first detailed survey of Bodiam Castle in 1864 and undertook repairs to the tower at the southwest corner of the site which had almost entirely collapsed Because there was then a fashion for ruins covered in ivy the vegetation was not removed despite its detrimental effect on the masonry and the trees which had taken root in the courtyard were left 27 Lord Curzon decided that so rare a treasure as Bodiam Castle should neither be lost to our country nor desecrated by irreverent hands 27 Curzon made enquiries about buying the castle but Cubitt did not wish to sell However after Cubitt s death Curzon was able to make a deal with Cubitt s son and he bought Bodiam Castle and its lands in 1916 29 Curzon began a programme of investigation at Bodiam in 1919 and with architect William Weir restored parts of the castle The moat on average about 5 ft 1 5 m deep but 7 ft 2 1 m deep in the southeast corner was drained and 3 ft 0 9 m of mud and silt removed during excavations the original footings of the bridges to the castle were discovered Nearby hedges and fences were removed to provide an unobscured view of the castle There were excavations in the interior and a well was discovered in the basement of the southwest tower Vegetation was cleared stonework repaired and the original floor level re established throughout the castle A cottage was built to provide a museum to display the finds from the excavations and a home for a caretaker Bodiam Castle was given to the National Trust in 1925 30 The National Trust continued the restoration work and added new roofs to the towers and gatehouse Excavations were resumed in 1970 and the moat was once again drained 31 Bodiam Castle was used in Monty Python and the Holy Grail 1975 in an establishing shot identifying it as Swamp Castle in the Tale of Sir Lancelot sequence 32 It had previously been used for the filming of Camelot an episode of The Goodies broadcast in 1973 33 It was later the filming location for the Doctor Who serial The King s Demons broadcast in 1983 34 The Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England carried out a survey of the earthworks surrounding Bodiam Castle in 1990 35 In the 1990s Bodiam Castle was at the centre of a debate in castle studies over the balance between militaristic and social interpretations of such sites 36 The arguments focused on elements such as the apparent strength of the defences such as the imposing moat and elements of display It has been suggested that the moat could have been drained in a day because the embankment surrounding it was not substantial and that as such it did not pose a serious obstacle to an attacker Also the large windows in the castle s exterior were defensive weak points 37 The castle is a Scheduled Monument 38 which means it is a nationally important historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change 39 It is also a Grade I listed building 40 and recognised as an internationally important structure 41 Today the castle is open to the public 42 and according to figures released by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions nearly 175 598 people visited in 2017 43 In the opinion of historian Charles Coulson Bodiam represents the popular ideal of a medieval castle 44 The castle s location was ostensibly chosen to protect England s south coast from raids by the French A landscape survey by the Royal Commission for Historic Monuments concluded that if this were the case then Bodiam Castle was unusually sited as it is far from the medieval coastline 36 The area surrounding Bodiam Castle was landscaped when the castle was built to increase its aesthetic appeal 46 Archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham have described Bodiam as one of the best examples of landscaping to emphasise a castle 47 The water features were originally extensive but only the moat survives along with the earthworks left over from its construction Roughly rectangular the moat is supplied by several springs some of them within it 46 which made it difficult to drain during the excavations of the 1930s 31 A moat can prevent attackers from gaining access to the base of a castle s walls but in the case of Bodiam it also had the effect of making the castle appear larger and more impressive by isolating it in its landscape The moat is now regarded more as an ornamental feature than a defence The approach to the castle through the moat and satellite ponds was indirect giving visitors time to view the castle in its intended splendour 48 Military historian Cathcart King describes the approach as formidable and considers it the equal of the 13th century castles of Edward I in Wales such as Caerphilly Castle 49 The castle sits roughly in the middle of the moat The postern gate at the rear would have been connected to the moat s south bank by a drawbridge and a long timber bridge The main entrance on the north side of the castle is today connected to the north bank by a wooden bridge but the original route would have included two bridges one from the main entrance to an island in the moat and another connecting the island to the west bank For the most part the bridge was static apart from the section closest to the west bank which would have been a drawbridge 50 The island in the moat is called the Octagon and excavations on it have uncovered a garderobe toilet suggesting that there may have been a guard on the island although it is unclear to what extent it was fortified The Octagon was connected to a barbican by a bridge probably a drawbridge 51 The castle s 28 toilets drained directly into the moat which in the words of archaeologist Matthew Johnson would have been effectively an open sewer 52 A quadrangular castle Bodiam is roughly square shaped This type of castle with a central courtyard and buildings against the curtain wall was characteristic of castle architecture in the 14th century Bodiam Castle has been described by military historian Cathcart King as the most complete surviving example of a quadrangular castle 53 There are circular towers at each of the four corners with square central towers in the south east and west walls The main entrance is a twin towered gatehouse in the north face of the castle There is a second entrance from the south the postern gate is through a square tower in the middle of the south wall 54 The towers are three storeys high taller than the curtain walls and the buildings in the castle which are two storeys high 55 Between the Octagon and the main gatehouse in the north wall was a barbican of which little survives just a piece of the west wall although the structure was originally two stories high The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican s north gate although there are no hinges for gates The base of a garderobe demonstrates that the second story would have provided space for habitation probably a guard room Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway 51 The gatehouse in the castle s north wall is three storeys high now reached by a static bridge it was originally connected to the barbican by a drawbridge The top of the gatehouse is machicolated and the approach is overlooked by gun loops in the gatehouse towers 56 The gatehouse is the only part of the castle which has gun loops and the curtain wall and towers are studded with windows for domestic use rather than military 49 There are guardrooms on the ground floor and a basement beneath them 56 The passage would originally have had three wooden portcullises 49 Above the entrance passage is an arch in the gateway although it leads nowhere The ceiling of the passage through the gatehouse into the castle is vaulted and pierced with murder holes 56 Murder holes were most likely used to drop objects on attackers similar to machicolations or to pour water to extinguish fires 57 Just above the gate there are three coats of arms carved in relief into the arch from left to right they are the arms of the Wardeux Dalyngrigge and Radynden families The Wardeux family was that of Edward Dalyngrigge s wife the Radyndens were relations of the Dalyngrigges Above the arms is a helm bearing a unicorn head crest Three coats of arms also decorate the postern gate the central arms is that of Sir Robert Knolles who Edward Dalyngrigge had fought for in the Hundred Years War but those flanking it are blank 58 Although the exterior of Bodiam Castle has largely survived the interior is ruinous The domestic buildings within the castle lined the curtain walls However remains are substantial enough to recreate a plan of the castle 59 The structure was divided into separate living areas for the lord and his family high status guests the garrisons and servants 60 The south range of the castle consisted of the great hall the kitchens and associated rooms The great hall to the east of the centrally located postern gate was 24 by 40 feet 7 3 by 12 2 m and would have been as tall as the curtain wall To the west of the great hall was the pantry and buttery linked to the great hall by a screens passage The three standing arches gave access to different rooms the pantry buttery and the kitchen which was at the far west of the south range This layout was typical of large medieval houses The great hall was the social centre of the castle and where the lord would have entertained guests 61 The buttery and pantry occupied the bottom floor and above was a room of unknown purpose The buttery had a cellar and was used to store ale and wine while the pantry held the supplies for the kitchen To prevent heat from the cooking fires becoming unbearable the kitchen was as tall as the curtain walls to provide a large space to absorb the heat In the southwest tower was a well from which water would have been drawn for the household 62 Along the east wall is a chapel a hall and an antechamber To accommodate the chapel the curtain wall near the northeast corner projects 9 feet 2 7 m further into the moat than the rest of the wall along the east side Immediately south of the chapel was the main accommodation for the lord and his family The buildings were two storeys high and incorporated a basement The exact layout of the rooms is unclear 63 Arranged along the west curtain wall was an extra hall and a kitchen it is not certain what these were used for although it is probable that these were intended to provide for the household s retainers The retainers hall had no windows on its west side and would have been relatively dark compared to the great hall Also whereas the great hall had a large fireplace the retainers hall had none The hall was adjacent to the kitchen to which it was directly connected with no screens passage in between Above the retainers hall which was confined to the ground floor was a room with no fireplace and of unclear purpose 64 East of the main gatehouse was a two storey building with a basement The basement was probably used for storage while the above two floors provided accommodation 60 The purpose of the buildings along the west end of the north range is uncertain The sparse arrangement with little provision for lighting has led to suggestions that it was used as stables however there are no drains which are usually associated with stables The tower in the northwest corner of the castle had a garderobe and fireplace on each of the three above ground floors and there was a basement underneath 65 Footnotes Bibliography
