Air Force in 1928 he commanded No 101 Fleet Cooperation Flight in the early 1930s and No 104 Bomber Squadron RAF on exchange in Britain shortly before World War II Hewitt was appointed the RAAF s Assistant Chief of the Air Staff in 1941 The following year he was posted to Allied Air Forces Headquarters South West Pacific Area as Director of Intelligence In 1943 he took command of No 9 Operational Group the RAAF s main mobile strike force but was controversially sacked by the Chief of the Air Staff Air Vice Marshal George Jones less than a year later over alleged morale and disciplinary issues Described as a small dapper man 1 who was outspoken even cocky 2 Hewitt overcame the setback to his career during the war and made his most significant contributions afterwards as Air Member for Personnel from 1945 to 1948 Directly responsible for the demobilisation of thousands of wartime staff and the consolidation of what was then the world s fourth largest air force into a much smaller peacetime service he also helped modernise education and training within the RAAF Hewitt was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1951 the same year he became Air Member for Supply and Equipment Retiring from the military in 1956 he went into business and later managed his own publishing house He wrote two books including Adversity in Success a first hand account of the South West Pacific air war before his death in 1985 aged 84 Born on 13 April 1901 in Tylden Victoria Joseph Eric Hewitt was the son of Joseph Henry Hewitt and his wife Rose Alice n√©e Harkness 3 4 He attended Scotch College Melbourne before entering the Royal Australian Naval College at Jervis Bay in 1915 aged 13 1 After graduating in 1918 Hewitt was posted to Britain as a midshipmen to serve with the Royal Navy 3 He rose to lieutenant in the RAN before volunteering for secondment to the Royal Australian Air Force RAAF as a flight lieutenant in January 1923 1 5 Hewitt undertook the pilots course at No 1 Flying Training School Point Cook and graduated at the end of the year 6 He was further seconded to the Royal Air Force in May 1925 7 holding a temporary commission as a flying officer until September 8 He married Lorna Bishop in Sydney on 10 November they had three daughters 3 In August 1926 Hewitt joined the newly formed No 101 Fleet Cooperation Flight operating Seagull III amphibians Prior to the unit deploying to Queensland to survey the Great Barrier Reef with HMAS Moresby he practiced manoeuvres around the centre of Melbourne landing in the Yarra River near Flinders Street station Media criticism of the escapade led to him being brought before the Chief of the Air Staff Group Captain Richard Williams who rather than upbraiding Hewitt expressed himself reservedly pleased about the publicity After completing its survey work in November 1928 the unit served aboard the seaplane carrier HMAS Albatross 9 Hewitt s transfer to the Air Force was made permanent in April 1928 3 Promoted to squadron leader he became commanding officer of No 101 Flight in February 1931 3 10 and supervised embarkation of the Seagull aboard the cruiser HMAS Australia in September October 1932 11 Hewitt finished his tour with No 101 Flight the following year and was posted to Britain in 1934 He attended RAF Staff College Andover in his first year abroad and served as Assistant Liaison Officer at Australia House London in 1935 4 Although a specialist seaplane pilot he converted to bombers in England flying Hawker Hinds and Bristol Blenheims as commanding officer of No 104 Squadron RAF from 1936 1 12 Hewitt was promoted wing commander in January 1938 Returning to Australia he was appointed senior air staff officer SASO at RAAF Station Richmond New South Wales in June 3 In May 1939 Hewitt was chosen to lead No 10 Squadron due to be formed on 1 July at the recently established RAAF Station Rathmines near Lake Macquarie He was preparing to depart for England to take delivery of the unit s planned complement of Short Sunderland flying boats when he broke his neck riding his motor cycle near Richmond and had to forgo the assignment while he recovered Fit for duty by August he was given command of the Rathmines base to manage the deployment of No 10 Squadron and its aircraft but this was suspended due to the outbreak of World War II in September and the Sunderlands and their RAAF crews remained in Britain for service alongside the RAF 13 On 20 November 1939 the RAAF formed No 1 Group in Melbourne 14 which evolved into Southern Area Command early in 1940 with Hewitt as senior administration staff officer 4 15 Having been promoted group captain in December 1939 Hewitt was made Director of Personal Services DPS at RAAF Headquarters in July 1940 3 He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 11 July for his performance as SASO at Richmond 3 16 Described by author Joyce Thompson as having a Calvinist background and rigid ideas on women s place in society as DPS Hewitt opposed the creation of the Women s Auxiliary Australian Air Force WAAAF and later advocated that its members be enrolled on a contractual basis rather than enlisted or commissioned as Permanent Air Force staff 17 Promoted acting air commodore he became Acting Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1941 3 18 In January 1942 he was posted to the staff of American British Dutch Australian Command in the Dutch East Indies 3 Hewitt served as Assistant Chief of the Air Staff in March and April before being assigned to the newly formed Allied Air Forces Headquarters AAF HQ South West Pacific Area SWPA as Director of Intelligence 18 19 He established cordial working relations with his American peers at AAF HQ becoming a confidant of its commander Major General George Kenney 2 In February 1943 Hewitt was appointed Air Officer Commanding AOC No 9 Operational Group No 9 OG 20 The RAAF s main mobile strike force No 9 OG initially comprised seven Australian combat squadrons and came under the control of the US Fifth Air Force 20 21 The month he took over Hewitt s squadrons were reorganised into two wings based in New Guinea No 71 Wing comprising units at Milne Bay New Guinea and No 73 Wing comprising those at Port Moresby 22 In March No 9 OG led the RAAF s contribution to the Battle of the Bismarck Sea the decisive aerial engagement in the SWPA according to General Douglas MacArthur resulting in 12 Japanese ships being sunk 23 Hewitt occasionally flew with his crews on operations contrary to General Kenney s policy against commanders taking such risks 24 By April 1943 Hewitt had been dragged into the divisive personal conflict between the Chief of the Air Staff Air Vice Marshal George Jones and the AOC of RAAF Command Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock RAAF Command was the Air Force s main operational formation in the Pacific controlling 24 Australian squadrons Jones administrative and de jure head of the RAAF sought to extend his authority into the sphere of operations by posting a more accountable officer into Bostock s position namely Hewitt 20 25 The Minister for Air Arthur Drakeford backed Jones manoeuvre but was informed by Prime Minister John Curtin that MacArthur as Supreme Commander SWPA would insist on the replacement of AVM Bostock by an equally able officer and that Air Commodore Hewitt was not considered an adequate replacement 26 Hewitt recognised qualities in both Jones and Bostock and tried not to take sides in their feud 27 No changes were made to command arrangements in the South West Pacific following this episode and Hewitt continued to lead No 9 OG in its bombing and strafing campaign against Japanese airfields and lines of communication in New Britain north east of New Guinea By mid June 1943 he had set up Group Headquarters at Milne Bay and No 73 Wing HQ at Goodenough Island On 22 July he mounted an operation against Gasmata airfield using 62 aircraft from five of his squadrons the largest strike undertaken by the Australians to that date 28 No 9 OG would take most of the credit for the RAAF reaching a peak of 254 tons of bombs dropped in October as against 137 tons delivered the previous month 29 On 8 November Hewitt sent out a formation of three Bristol Beauforts in a severe electrical storm to attack the heavily defended harbour at Rabaul This was conceived as a make or break effort to prove the worth or otherwise of the Beaufort as a torpedo bomber in which role it had so far been a disappointment in what the official history of the RAAF in World War II described as an heroic attack at least one enemy tanker was struck for the loss of one Beaufort 30 The planning and execution of the raid led to conflict between Hewitt and the commanding officer of the Beaufort squadron Wing Commander G D Nicoll and Hewitt dismissed Nicoll shortly afterwards the decision was swiftly reversed by Air Vice Marshal Jones 3 Although Hewitt was performing an excellent job according to Fifth Air Force commander Major General Ennis Whitehead he was controversially removed from his post in mid November 1943 by Jones over accusations of poor discipline and morale within No 9 OG 20 31 RAAF historian Alan Stephens later described the circumstances of Hewitt s dismissal as murky and the allegations leading to it as unofficial 20 Drakeford defended Hewitt s service record informing the Prime Minister that the present position may be largely if not entirely due to some temporary physical stress brought about by the strain of his important duties as A O C of No 9 Group 31 Hewitt himself believed that he had been smeared by a disgruntled former staff officer 2 historian Kristen Alexander identified Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger who would play a leading part in the Morotai Mutiny of 1945 as having made allegations regarding Hewitt s supposed lack of balance vanity and lack of purpose in the prosecution of the war 32 Hewitt returned to his previous position as Director of Intelligence at Allied Air Headquarters and the Air Member of Personnel Air Commodore Frank Lukis took over as AOC No 9 OG in December 27 General Kenney considered Hewitt s removal bad news 20 After completing his tour as Director of Intelligence at AAF HQ at the end of 1944 Hewitt became acting Air Member for Personnel AMP in 1945 33 As AMP Hewitt sat on the Air Board the RAAF s controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff 34 Along with the other members of the board he reviewed the findings of the inquiry by Justice John Vincent Barry into the Morotai Mutiny which had involved senior pilots of the Australian First Tactical Air Force No 1 TAF attempting to resign their commissions to protest the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to strategically unimportant ground attack missions Hewitt recommended that the AOC No 1 TAF Air Commodore Harry Cobby be removed from command along with his two senior staff officers The majority of the Air Board saw no reason to take such action leaving Hewitt to append a dissenting note to its decision Drakeford supported Hewitt s position and the three senior No 1 TAF officers were later dismissed from their posts by Air Vice Marshal Jones 32 Hewitt s appointment as Air Member for Personnel was made permanent following the end of World War II in August 1945 33 In this role he was directly responsible for the demobilisation of what had become the world s fourth largest air force and its transition to a much smaller peacetime service 33 35 Hewitt considered that the RAAF was in danger of losing some of its best staff through rapid unplanned demobilisation and recommended that its workforce be stabilised for two years at a strength of 20 000 while it reviewed its post war requirements Although the Air Board supported Hewitt s proposal government cost cutting resulted in the strength of the so called Interim Air Force remaining lower than planned being reduced to some 13 000 by October 1946 and under 8 000 by the end of 1948 36 Despite claiming that employing women in the Air Force was an important factor in reducing antagonism and prejudice against them in the work force in general Hewitt also recommended that the WAAAF be disbanded after the war 37 As AMP Hewitt was responsible for reviewing the potential employment of senior officers in the post war Air Force This review led to the early retirement of such figures as Air Marshal Richard Williams and Air Vice Marshals Stanley Goble Bill Bostock Frank McNamara Bill Anderson Henry Wrigley and Adrian Cole ostensibly to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers 38 39 Hewitt helped draft the letters to each of the retirees explaining the reasons for the decision and redundancy payments involved 39 He was also responsible for rationalising the Air Force List of officers and their seniority that had become a source of numerous irregularities due to the temporary and acting promotions granted during wartime This resulted in many officers of senior rank being demoted as many as three levels such as group captain to flight lieutenant in the first post war List released in June 1947 40 Hewitt was responsible for initiating major improvements in Air Force education that took place between 1945 and 1953 playing a key role in the establishment of RAAF College and the introduction of an apprenticeship training programme The purpose of the College was in Hewitt s words to sow the seeds of service for future leaders helping create a special RAAF esprit de corps He added that it was almost a truism that the future RAAF can be no better than the Air Force College 41 Founded at Point Cook in January 1948 RAAF College s inaugural commandant was Air Commodore Val Hancock who also drafted its first charter 42 With the support of the Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance Air Vice Marshal Ellis Wackett Hewitt developed the Apprenticeship Training Scheme to raise the standard of technical roles in the Air Force introducing it with a nationwide publicity campaign to attract recruits Its base was the Ground Training School which opened at Wagga New South Wales in early 1948 to provide education and technical training for youths aged 15 to 17 It was renamed RAAF Technical College in 1950 and the RAAF School of Technical Training in 1952 43 Parallel to his initiatives in Air Force education and training Hewitt introduced a revised aircrew ranking scheme that consisted of skill categories with various levels such as navigator level 4 or pilot level 1 rather than the regular military ranks such as sergeant or flight lieutenant This was abandoned in 1950 due to dissatisfaction caused by the lack of obvious equivalence between these specialist ranks and the traditional ranking system common to the rest of the RAAF and other defence forces 44 After completing his term as Air Member for Personnel in 1948 he was posted to London as the Australian Defence Representative 4 By now promoted air vice marshal Hewitt was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1951 New Year Honours in part for his leadership of No 9 OG during the war 3 45 Returning from Britain the same year he took over as Air Member for Supply and Equipment AMSE from Air Vice Marshal George Mackinolty who had died suddenly of cancer 46 47 Hewitt served as AMSE until his retirement from the RAAF in April 1956 1 47 In this role he again cooperated with Air Vice Marshal Wackett now the Air Member for Technical Services to introduce the concept of acquiring spare parts based on life of type whereby the forecast number and type of spares necessary for an aircraft s projected service life would be ordered when it was first deployed operationally to reduce support costs and delivery times 48 Following his retirement from the Air Force in 1956 Hewitt joined International Harvester Co Australia as Manager of Education and Training He became a trustee of the Services Canteen Trust the same year serving in this position until 1977 Having retired from International Harvester in 1966 Hewitt became an author in later life and wrote two books on his experiences in the military 4 The first Adversity in Success was published in 1980 and gave his account of the air war in the South West Pacific He followed it in 1984 with The Black One Hewitt also acted as chairman and managing director of his own publishing house Langate Publishing 1 4 Predeceased by his wife Lorna he died in Melbourne on 1 November 1985 and was survived by his daughters 3 Historian Alan Stephens credits Hewitt with being primarily responsible for the education revolution that took place in the RAAF between 1945 and 1953 noting that Hewitt s initiatives while Air Member for Personnel were carried on by his successor in the position Air Vice Marshal Frank Bladin 49 According to Stephens and Jeff Isaacs the importance of RAAF College and the Apprenticeship Training Scheme in contributing to the professionalism of the post war service cannot be over stated 1 Air Vice Marshal Ernie Hey the Air Member for Technical Services from 1960 through 1972 declared that the apprenticeship programme was one of the best things the RAAF ever established and that its graduates numbering some 5 500 from 1952 to 1993 were absolutely outstanding 50 Joe Hewitt is commemorated by Hewitt Reef in Great Barrier Reef Marine Park named in his honour by the survey team on HMAS Moresby with whom he worked as a member of No 101 Flight in 1926 1928 9 Hewitt also founded an eponymous trophy for small arms proficiency in the Air Force 51 52
