remote mountaintop on 4 December 1950 while supporting ground troops at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir Brown died of his wounds despite the efforts of wingman Thomas J Hudner Jr who intentionally crashed his own aircraft in a rescue attempt for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor Brown s successes in the segregated and desegregated U S military were memorialized in several books The frigate USS Jesse L Brown FF 1089 was named in his honor Brown was born on 13 October 1926 in Hattiesburg Mississippi 2 3 He was one of six children born to Julia Lindsey Brown a schoolteacher and John Brown a grocery warehouse worker 4 He had four brothers Marvin William Fletcher and Lura as well as an older sister known as Johnny Brown s ancestry was African American Chickasaw and Choctaw 5 The family lived in a house without central heating or indoor plumbing so they relied on a fireplace for warmth As a child Jesse s brother William fell into this fireplace and was severely burned 6 At the beginning of the Great Depression John Brown lost his job and relocated the family to Palmer s Crossing 10 miles 16 km from Hattiesburg where he worked at a turpentine factory until he was laid off in 1938 7 John Brown moved the family to Lux Mississippi where he worked as a sharecropper on a farm 6 During this time Jesse Brown shared a bed with his brothers as was common among many families and attended a one room school 3 miles 4 8 km away His parents were very strict about school attendance and homework and Jesse Brown walked to school every day 8 The Browns also were committed Baptists and Jesse William and Julia Brown sang in the church choir 6 In his spare time Brown also worked in the fields of the farm harvesting corn and cotton 9 When Brown was six years old his father took him to an air show 10 Brown gained an intense interest in flying from this experience and afterward was attracted to a dirt airfield near his home which he visited frequently in spite of being chased away by a local mechanic 6 At the age of thirteen Brown took a job as a paperboy for the Pittsburgh Courier a black press paper 11 and developed a desire to pilot while reading in the newspaper about African American aviators of the time including C Alfred Anderson Eugine Jacques Bullard and Bessie Coleman 6 He also became an avid reader of Popular Aviation and the Chicago Defender which he later said heavily influenced his desire to fly naval aircraft 12 In his childhood he was described as serious witty unassuming and very intelligent 4 In 1937 he wrote a letter to U S President Franklin D Roosevelt in which he complained of the injustice of African American pilots being kept out of the U S Army Air Corps to which the White House responded with a letter saying that it appreciated the viewpoint 13 Because the schools closer to his family were of lower quality in 1939 Brown lived with his aunt and attended the segregated Eureka High School in Hattiesburg 6 He was a member of the basketball football and track and field teams 4 and he was an excellent student graduating as the salutatorian in 1944 3 6 During this time Brown met his future wife Daisy Pearl Nix 6 Following graduation Brown sought to enroll in a college outside of the South His principal Nathaniel Burger advised he attend an all black college as his brother Marvin Brown had done But he enrolled at Ohio State University as his childhood role model Jesse Owens had done Burger told Brown that only seven African Americans had graduated from the university that year but Brown was determined to enroll believing that he could compete well with white students 14 Brown took several side jobs to save money for college including waiting tables at the Holmes Club a saloon for white U S Army soldiers In this job Brown was frequently the target of racist vitriol and abuse but he persevered earning 600 to pay for college 14 In the autumn of 1944 Brown left Mississippi on a segregated train for Columbus Ohio where he started at Ohio State 15 Brown moved into an on campus boarding house at 61 East Eleventh Avenue in the primarily black neighborhood of the University District in Columbus 16 He majored in architectural engineering Brown attempted several times to apply to the school s aviation program but was denied because of his race 17 Brown joined the track and field team as well as the wrestling team but soon dropped both for financial reasons He took a job as a janitor at a local Lazarus department store and was hired by the Pennsylvania Railroad to load boxcars from 15 30 to midnight each day 14 In spite of this he maintained top grades in his classes 4 Although facing difficulties with academics and the institutional segregation in the city Brown found that most of his fellow students were friendly toward him 18 Brown rarely returned to Mississippi during the school year but in the summers he worked at a dry cleaner in Hattiesburg to help pay for his classes 19 During his second year in college Brown learned of the V 5 Aviation Cadet Training Program being conducted by the U S Navy to commission naval aviation pilots 3 This program operated at 52 colleges none of which was a historically black college so only students such as Brown who attended integrated colleges were eligible 20 In spite of resistance from recruiters Brown passed the entrance exams 14 Brown enlisted in the U S Naval Reserve on 8 July 1946 4 and was admitted to the aviation program becoming a Seaman Apprentice in the U S Navy and a member of the school s Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps NROTC program A 50 monthly stipend allowed him to quit his jobs and concentrate on his studies he completed his architectural engineering degree in 1947 14 At this time the NROTC was the normal route to a regular Naval commission but only 14 of the more than 5 600 NROTC students in 1947 were black 20 On 15 March 1947 Brown reported to Glenview Naval Air Station in Glenview Illinois for Naval Flight Officer training 4 There his enlistment ended 15 April and Brown reverted to the rank of midshipman becoming the only African American in the program Although he anticipated antagonism he found the other cadets were generally friendly and welcoming 14 He found many of the black cooks and janitors hostile to him however possibly due to jealousy 21 Brown got his first flight time aboard a Stearman N2S trainer aircraft 22 In spite of the rigors of the initial training Brown was encouraged by instructors and completed the first phase of training transferring to Ottumwa Naval Air Station in Ottumwa Iowa for the next phase 4 The Ottumwa training involved intense physical fitness and technical training which Brown completed 14 Thereafter he was moved to Pensacola Naval Air Station in Pensacola Florida to train in aircraft flight In Pensacola Brown and Nix married in secret as naval cadets were not allowed to marry until their training was complete under threat of immediate dismissal Nix took a room in Pensacola and the two visited one another on weekends 23 In spite of overt racism from at least one instructor and several classmates at this posting 4 Brown completed the rigorous training in August 1947 23 By June 1948 Brown had begun training for carrier based aircraft and hoped to fly either the F4U Corsair or F6F Hellcat both of which were fighters He trained in carrier takeoffs and landings aboard the light carrier USS Wright 24 after which he was sent to Jacksonville Florida for final flight qualifications On 21 October 1948 he completed his training and was given his Naval Aviator Badge 3 4 23 This accomplishment was widely publicized and Brown became known nationally The Associated Press profiled him and his photograph appeared in Life magazine Author Theodore Taylor later wrote that through Brown s efforts to become a pilot he had broken the color barrier which had been longstanding and preventing blacks in naval aviation 25 Brown was commissioned as an ensign in the U S Navy on 26 April 1949 3 He was assigned to Quonset Point Naval Air Station in Quonset Rhode Island 23 as a part of the U S Atlantic Fleet Brown reported that incidents of racism and discrimination which had been harsh late in his training were substantially relieved once he became an officer 4 Following his commissioning Brown was assigned to temporary duty at Norfolk Naval Air Station in Norfolk Virginia 26 His daughter Pamela Elise Brown was born in December 23 In January 1949 Brown was assigned to Fighter Squadron 32 aboard USS Leyte 23 Over the next 18 months the unit conducted numerous training exercises along the East Coast many of them taking place at Quonset Point Brown reported here his superiors treated him fairly and held others to equal standards The unit trained rigorously in aircraft maneuvers 27 By the outbreak of the Korean War he had gained a reputation among the others in the squadron as an experienced pilot and a capable section leader 28 He was well liked among other pilots and the black stewards and support staff of the carrier Brown did not socialize much with the other pilots however and was known to spend as much time as possible visiting his wife He was able to reveal his marriage following his commissioning 29 30 On the night of 25 June 1950 ten divisions of the North Korean People s Army launched a full scale invasion of the nation s neighbor to the south the Republic of Korea The force of 89 000 men moved in six columns catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise resulting in a rout The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment and was unprepared for war 31 The numerically superior North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38 000 South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south 32 Most of South Korea s forces retreated in the face of the invasion 33 The North Koreans were well on their way to South Korea s capital of Seoul within hours forcing the government and its shattered army to retreat farther south 33 To prevent South Korea s collapse the United Nations Security Council voted to send military forces The United States Seventh Fleet dispatched Task Force 77 led by the fleet carrier USS Valley Forge the British Far East Fleet dispatched several ships including HMS Triumph to provide air and naval support 34 Although the navies blockaded North Korea and launched aircraft to delay the North Korean forces these efforts alone did not stop the North Korean Army juggernaut on its southern advance 35 U S President Harry S Truman ordered ground troops into the country to supplement the air support 36 All U S Navy units including Leyte were placed on alert 23 At the time the ship was in the Mediterranean Sea and Brown did not expect to be deployed to Korea but on 8 August a relief carrier arrived in the area and Leyte was ordered to Korea 37 Commanders felt the pilots on the carrier were better trained and hence needed in the theater The ship sailed from the Strait of Gibraltar across the Atlantic Ocean and to Quonset then through the Panama Canal and to San Diego California Hawaii and Japan before arriving in Korea around 8 October 38 The ship joined Task Force 77 off the northeast coast of the Korean Peninsula part of a fleet of 17 ships from the Seventh Fleet including the aircraft carrier USS Philippine Sea battleship USS Missouri and cruiser USS Juneau 39 Brown flew 20 missions in country 23 These missions included attacks on communication lines troop concentrations and military installations around Wonsan Chongpu Songjim and Senanju 28 Following the entrance of the People s Republic of China into the war in late November 1950 Brown and his squadron were dispatched to the Chosin Reservoir where an intense campaign was being fought between the People s Volunteer Army and the US X Corps 23 Approximately 100 000 Chinese troops had surrounded 15 000 U S troops and Brown and other pilots on Leyte flew dozens of close air support missions every day to prevent the Chinese from overrunning the U S troops 40 41 On 4 December 1950 Brown was part of a six aircraft flight supporting U S Marine Corps ground troops trapped by Chinese forces 42 At 13 38 KST Brown took off from Leyte with squadron executive officer Lieutenant Commander Dick Cevoli Lieutenant George Hudson Lieutenant Junior Grade Bill Koenig Ensign Ralph McQueen and Lieutenant Junior Grade Thomas J Hudner Jr who was Brown s wingman 43 During this flight Brown had the call sign Iroquois 13 44 The flight traveled 100 miles 160 km from the Task Force s location to the Chosin Reservoir flying 35 to 40 minutes through very harsh wintery conditions to the vicinity of the villages of Yudam ni and Hagaru ri The flight began searching for targets along the west side of the reservoir decreasing their altitude to 700 feet 210 m 45 The mission was a three hour search and destroy flight as well as an attempt to probe Chinese troop strength in the area 30 46 Although the flight spotted no Chinese at 14 40 Koenig radioed that Brown appeared to be trailing fuel 46 The damage had likely come by small arms fire from Chinese infantry who were known to hide in the snow and to ambush passing aircraft by firing in unison 29 At least one bullet had ruptured a fuel line Brown losing fuel pressure and increasingly unable to control the aircraft dropped his external fuel tanks and rockets and attempted to land the craft in a snow covered clearing on the side of a mountain Brown crashed into a bowl shaped valley at approximately 40 36 N 127 06 E 40 600 N 127 100 E 40 600 127 100 46 47 The aircraft broke up violently upon impact and was destroyed 44 In the crash Brown s leg was pinned beneath the fuselage of the aircraft and he stripped off his helmet and gloves in an attempt to free himself before waving to the other pilots who were circling close overhead 23 The other pilots had thought he had died in the crash 46 Brown had crash landed near Somong ni 15 miles 24 km behind Chinese lines in 15 F 9 C weather 48 and the other pilots began a Mayday radio to any heavy transport aircraft in the area as they canvassed the mountain for any sign of Chinese ground forces who might threaten Brown 49 They received a signal that a rescue helicopter would come as soon as possible but Brown s aircraft was smoking and a fire had started near its internal fuel tanks 30 48 Before it became clear Brown was seriously injured Hudner attempted in vain to rescue Brown by radioing him instructions for escaping his damaged aircraft Hudner then intentionally crash landed his aircraft ran to Brown s side and attempted to wrestle him free from the wreck While Brown s condition worsened by the minute Hudner attempted in vain to put out the aircraft fire using snow and to pull Brown from the aircraft In great pain Brown began slipping in and out of consciousness 41 A rescue helicopter arrived around 15 00 its pilot Lieutenant Charles Ward and Hudner were unable to put out the engine fire with a fire extinguisher and tried unsuccessfully to free Brown with an axe for 45 minutes They even considered at Brown s request amputating his trapped leg 50 Brown lost consciousness shortly thereafter His last known words to Hudner were Tell Daisy I love her 23 41 The helicopter which was unable to operate in the darkness was forced to return to base at nightfall with Hudner leaving Brown behind Brown is believed to have died shortly thereafter of his injuries and exposure to the extreme cold No Chinese forces threatened the site likely owing to the heavy air presence of Brown and Hudner s unit 51 Hudner begged superiors to allow him to return to the wreck to help extract Brown but he was not allowed as other officers feared an ambush of the vulnerable helicopters resulting in casualties To prevent the body and the aircraft from falling into Chinese or North Korean hands the U S Navy bombed the aircraft with napalm two days later with pilots reportedly reciting the Lord s Prayer over the radio as they watched Brown s body be consumed by flames 52 The pilots observed that Brown s body was still stuck in the aircraft but his clothes were gone The remains of both Brown and the aircraft were never recovered 53 Brown was the first African American U S Navy officer killed in the war 52 54 55 Hudner speaking of Brown 17 February 1973 at the commissioning of the USS Jesse L Brown For his actions in Korea leading up to his death Brown was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross the Purple Heart Medal and the Air Medal 2 For the failed rescue attempt Hudner received the Medal of Honor the highest valor award presented by the U S military 56 57 58 Brown s shipmates memorialized him in a shipwide newspaper as a Christian soldier a gentleman a shipmate and friend His courage and faith shone like a beacon for all to see 23 As word of his death spread Brown inspired numerous other African Americans to become pilots notably Seaman Apprentice Frank E Petersen Petersen would become the first African American Marine Corps aviator and the first African American Marine Corps general graduating from the Naval Aviation Training Program in 1952 and retiring from the military after 38 years in 1988 with the rank of lieutenant general 23 On 17 February 1973 the Navy commissioned the Knox class frigate USS Jesse L Brown FF 1089 the third U S ship named in honor of an African American 59 Present at the commissioning ceremony in Boston Massachusetts were Daisy Brown Thorne who had remarried Pamela Brown and Hudner who gave a dedication 23 The ship was decommissioned on 27 July 1994 and renamed Damiyat after being commissioned with the Egyptian Navy 52 60 Brown also has a VA Hospital in Chicago named after formerly the known as the West Side VA Hospital In July 2013 Hudner visited Pyongyang in an attempt to recover Brown s remains from the crash site He was told by North Korean authorities to return in September when the weather is more predictable 61 62 While Brown is often cited as the first African American Naval Aviator historian Robert J Schneller has maintained that Lieutenant junior grade Oscar W Holmes preceded Brown earning the designation of Naval Aviator in 1943 with an exemption from the Navy s basic aviation training program due to his prior civilian piloting experience 63 In 1998 Theodore Taylor wrote a biography titled Flight of Jesse Leroy Brown interviewing Brown s acquaintances and with reference to his personal letters 64 65 In 2015 Brown was the subject of the biography Devotion An Epic Story of Heroism Friendship and Sacrifice by Adam Makos 66 67 68 Brown s military decorations and awards included the following 1 a His Distinguished Flying Cross citation reads The President of the United States of America takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross Posthumously to Ensign Jesse Leroy Brown NSN 0 504477 United States Navy for heroism in aerial flight as Pilot of a fighter plane in Fighter Squadron Thirty Two VF 32 attached to the USS Leyte CV 32 in hostile attacks on hostile North Korean forces Participating in 20 strikes on enemy military installations lines of communication transportation facilities and enemy troop concentrations in the face of grave hazard at the Chosin Reservoir Takshon Manp Jin Linchong Sinuiju Kasan Wonsan Chonjin Kilchu and Sinanju during the period 12 October to 4 December 1950 With courageous efficiency and utter disregard for his own personal safety Ensign Brown while in support of friendly troops in the Chosin Reservoir area pressed home numerous attacks destroying an enemy troop concentration moving to attack our troops So aggressive were these attacks in the face of enemy anti aircraft fire that they finally resulted in the destruction of Ensign Brown s plane by anti aircraft fire His gallant devotion to duty was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service 69 Online sources Media related to Jesse Leroy Brown at Wikimedia Commons
