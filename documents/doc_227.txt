Jin dynasty Eastern Xia 1233 Song dynasty Mongol Empire 1233 34 Mongol Empire 1211 33 The Jin Song Wars were a series of conflicts between the Jurchen Jin dynasty 1115 1234 and Han Chinese Song dynasty 960 1279 In 1115 Jurchen tribes rebelled against their overlords the Khitan Liao dynasty 907 1125 and declared the formation of the Jin Allying with the Song against their common enemy the Liao dynasty the Jin promised to return to the Song the Sixteen Prefectures that had fallen under Liao control since 938 The Chinese agreed but the Jurchens quick defeat of the Liao dynasty combined with Song dynasty military failures made the Jin reluctant to cede these territories After a series of negotiations that embittered both sides the Jurchens attacked the Song dynasty in 1125 dispatching one army to Taiyuan and the other to Bianjing modern Kaifeng the Song capital Surprised by news of an invasion Song general Tong Guan retreated from Taiyuan which was besieged and later captured As the second Jin army approached the capital Song emperor Huizong abdicated and fled south Qinzong his eldest son was enthroned The Jurchens laid siege to Kaifeng in 1126 but Qinzong negotiated their retreat from the capital by agreeing to a large annual indemnity Qinzong reneged on the deal and ordered Song forces to defend the prefectures instead of fortifying the capital The Jin resumed war and again besieged Kaifeng in 1127 They captured Emperor Qinzong of Song many members of the imperial family and high officials of the Song imperial court in an event known as the Jingkang Incident This separated north and south China between Jin and Song Remnants of the Song imperial family retreated to southern China and after brief stays in several temporary capitals eventually relocated to Lin an modern Hangzhou The retreat divided the dynasty into two distinct periods Northern Song and Southern Song The Jurchens tried to conquer southern China in the 1130s but were bogged down by a pro Song insurgency in the north and a counteroffensive by Song generals Yue Fei Han Shizhong and others The Song generals regained some territories but retreated on the orders of Southern Song emperor Gaozong who supported a peaceful resolution to the war The Treaty of Shaoxing 1142 set the boundary of the two empires along the Huai River but conflicts between the two dynasties continued until the fall of Jin in 1234 A war against the Song begun by the 4th Jin emperor Wanyan Liang was unsuccessful He lost the Battle of Caishi 1161 and was later assassinated by his own disaffected officers An invasion of Jin territory motivated by Song revanchism 1206 1208 was also unsuccessful A decade later Jin launched an abortive military campaign against the Song in 1217 to replace territory they had lost to the invading Mongols The Song allied with the Mongols in 1233 and in the next year jointly captured Caizhou the last refuge of the Jin emperor The Jin dynasty collapsed that year in 1234 After the demise of Jin the Song dynasty itself became a target of the Mongols and collapsed in 1279 The wars engendered an era of swift technological cultural and demographic changes in China Battles between the Song and Jin brought about the introduction of various gunpowder weapons The siege of De an in 1132 was the first recorded use of the fire lance an early ancestor of firearms There were also reports of battles fought with rudimentary gunpowder bombs like the incendiary huopao or the exploding tiehuopao incendiary arrows and other related weapons In northern China Jurchens were the ruling minority of an empire predominantly inhabited by former subjects of the Song Jurchen migrants settled in the conquered territories and assimilated with the local culture Jin a conquest dynasty instituted a centralized imperial bureaucracy modeled on previous Chinese dynasties basing their legitimacy on Confucian philosophy Song refugees from the north resettled in southern China The north was the cultural center of China and its conquest by Jin diminished the regional stature of the Song dynasty The Southern Song however quickly returned to economic prosperity and trade with Jin was lucrative despite decades of warfare Lin an the Southern Song capital expanded into a major city for commerce The Jurchens were a Tungusic speaking group of semi agrarian tribes inhabiting areas of northeast Asia that are now part of Northeast China Many of the Jurchen tribes were vassals of the Liao dynasty 907 1125 an empire ruled by the nomadic Khitans that included most of modern Mongolia a portion of North China Northeast China northern Korea and parts of the Russian Far East 1 To the south of the Liao lay the Han Chinese Song Empire 960 1276 2 The Song and Liao were at peace but since a military defeat to the Liao in 1005 the Song paid its northern neighbor an annual indemnity of 200 000 bolts of silk and 100 000 ounces of silver 3 Before the Jurchens overthrew the Khitan married Jurchen women and Jurchen girls were raped by Liao Khitan envoys as a custom which caused resentment by the Jurchens against the Khitan 4 Song princesses committed suicide to avoid rape or were killed for resisting rape by the Jin 5 In 1114 6 the chieftain Wanyan Aguda 1068 1123 united the disparate Jurchen tribes and led a revolt against the Liao In 1115 he named himself emperor of the Jin golden dynasty 1115 1234 7 Informed by a Liao defector of the success of the Jurchen uprising the Song emperor Huizong r 1100 1127 and his highest military commander the eunuch Tong Guan saw the Liao weakness as an opportunity to recover the Sixteen Prefectures a line of fortified cities and passes that the Liao had annexed from the Shatuo Turk Later Jin in 938 and that the Song had repeatedly but unsuccessfully tried to reconquer 8 The Song thus sought an alliance with the Jin against their common enemy the Liao 9 Because the land routes between the Song and Jin were controlled by the Liao diplomatic exchanges had to occur by traveling across the Bohai Sea 10 Negotiations for an alliance began secretly under the pretense that the Song wanted to acquire horses from the Khitans Song diplomats traveled to the Jin court to meet Aguda in 1118 while Jurchen envoys arrived in the Song capital Kaifeng the next year 9 At the beginning the two sides agreed to keep whatever Liao territory they would seize in combat 9 In 1120 Aguda agreed to cede the Sixteen Prefectures to the Song in exchange for transfer to the Jin of the annual tributary payments that the Song had been giving the Liao 11 By the end of 1120 however the Jurchens had seized the Liao Supreme Capital and offered the Song only parts of the Sixteen Prefectures 11 Among other things Jin would keep the Liao Western Capital of Datong at the western end of the Sixteen Prefectures 11 The two sides agreed that the Jin would now attack the Liao Central Capital whereas the Song would seize the Liao Southern Capital Yanjing modern day Beijing The joint attack against the Liao had been planned for 1121 but it was rescheduled for 1122 On February 23 of that year Jin captured the Liao Central Capital as promised 12 The Song delayed their entry into the war because it diverted resources to fighting the Western Xia in the northwest and suppressing a large popular rebellion led by Fang La in the south 13 When a Song army under Tong Guan s command finally attacked Yanjing in May 1122 the smaller forces of the weakened Liao repelled the invaders with ease 14 Another attack failed in the fall 14 Both times Tong was forced to retreat back to Kaifeng 15 After the first attack Aguda changed the terms of the agreement and only promised Yanjing and six other prefectures to the Song 16 In early 1123 it was Jurchen forces that easily took the Liao Southern Capital They sacked it and enslaved its population 16 The quick collapse of the Liao led to more negotiations between the Song and Jin Jurchen military success and their effective control over the Sixteen Prefectures gave them more leverage 16 Aguda grew increasingly frustrated as he realized that despite their military failures the Song still intended to seize most of the prefectures 17 In the spring of 1123 the two sides finally set the terms of the first Song Jin treaty 18 Only seven prefectures including Yanjing would be returned to the Song and the Song would pay an annual indemnity of 300 000 packs of silk and 200 000 taels of silver to the Jin as well as a one time payment of one million strings of copper coins to compensate the Jurchens for the tax revenue they would have earned had they not returned the prefectures 19 In May 1123 Tong Guan and the Song armies entered the looted Yanjing 16 Barely one month after the Song had recovered Yanjing Zhang Jue 張覺 who had served as military governor of the Liao prefecture of Pingzhou about 200 kilometres 120 mi east of Yanjing killed the main Jin official in that city and turned it over to the Song 20 The Jurchens defeated his armies a few months later and Zhang took refuge in Yanjing Even though the Song agreed to execute him in late 1123 this incident put tension between the two states because the 1123 treaty had explicitly forbidden both sides from harboring defectors 21 In 1124 Song officials further angered Jin by asking for the cession of nine more border prefectures 21 The new Jin emperor Taizong r 1123 1135 Aguda s brother and successor hesitated but warrior princes Wanyan Zonghan and Wanyan Zongwang 完颜宗望 vehemently refused to give them any more territory Taizong eventually granted two prefectures but by then the Jin leaders were ready to attack their southern neighbor 22 Before they could invade the Song the Jurchens reached a peace agreement with their western neighbors the Tangut Western Xia in 1124 The following year near the Ordos Desert they captured Tianzuo the last emperor of the Liao putting an end to the Liao dynasty for good 23 Ready to end their alliance with the Song the Jurchens began preparations for an invasion 24 In November 1125 Taizong ordered his armies to attack the Song 23 The defection of Zhang Jue two years earlier served as the casus belli 21 Two armies were sent to capture the major cities of the Song 22 The western army led by Wanyan Zonghan departed from Datong and headed towards Taiyuan through the mountains of Shanxi on its way to the Song western capital Luoyang 25 The Song forces were not expecting an invasion and were caught off guard The Chinese general Tong Guan was informed of the military expedition by an envoy he had sent to the Jin to obtain the cession of two prefectures The returning envoy reported that the Jurchens were willing to forgo an invasion if the Song ceded control of Hebei and Shanxi to the Jin 26 Tong Guan retreated from Taiyuan and left command of his troops to Wang Bing 27 Jin armies besieged the city in mid January 1126 28 Under Wang Bing s command Taiyuan held on long enough to stop the Jurchen troops from advancing to Luoyang 27 Meanwhile the eastern army commanded by Wanyan Zongwang was dispatched towards Yanjing modern Beijing and eventually the Song capital Kaifeng It did not face much armed opposition Zongwang easily took Yanjing where Song general and former Liao governor Guo Yaoshi 郭藥師 switched his allegiances to the Jin 27 When the Song had tried to reclaim the Sixteen Prefectures they had faced fierce resistance from the Han Chinese population yet when the Jurchens invaded that area the Han Chinese did not oppose them at all 29 By the end of December 1125 the Jin army had seized control of two prefectures and re established Jurchen rule over the Sixteen Prefectures 26 The eastern army was nearing Kaifeng by early 1126 27 Fearing the approaching Jin army Song emperor Huizong planned to retreat south The emperor deserting the capital would have been viewed as an act of capitulation so court officials convinced him to abdicate 27 There were few objections Rescuing an empire in crisis from destruction was more important than preserving the rituals of imperial inheritance In January 1126 a few days before the New Year Huizong abdicated in favor of his son and was demoted to the ceremonial role of Retired Emperor 30 The Jurchen forces reached the Yellow River on January 27 1126 two days after the New Year 23 Huizong fled Kaifeng the next day escaping south and leaving the newly enthroned emperor Qinzong r 1126 1127 in charge of the capital 23 Kaifeng was besieged on January 31 1126 31 The commander of the Jurchen army promised to spare the city if the Song submitted to Jin as a vassal forfeited the prime minister and an imperial prince as prisoners ceded the Chinese prefectures of Hejian Taiyuan and Zhongshan and offered an indemnity of 50 million taels of silver 5 million taels of gold 1 million packs of silk 1 million packs of satin 10 000 horses 10 000 mules 10 000 cattle and 1 000 camels 32 This indemnity was worth about 180 years of the annual tribute the Song had been paying to the Jin since 1123 33 With little prospect of help from afar arriving infighting broke out in the Song court between the officials who supported the Jin offer and those who opposed it 30 Opponents of the treaty like Li Gang 李剛 1083 1140 rallied around the proposal of remaining in defensive positions until reinforcements arrived and Jurchen supplies ran out They botched an ambush against the Jin that was carried out at night and were replaced by officials who supported peace negotiations 34 The failed attack pushed Qinzong into meeting the Jurchen demands and his officials convinced him to go through with the deal 35 The Song recognized Jin control over the three prefectures 36 The Jurchen army ended the siege in March after 33 days 31 Almost as soon as the Jin armies had left Kaifeng Emperor Qinzong reneged on the deal and dispatched two armies to repel the Jurchen troops attacking Taiyuan and bolster the defenses of Zhongshan and Hejian An army of 90 000 soldiers and another of 60 000 were defeated by Jin forces by June A second expedition to rescue Taiyuan was also unsuccessful 31 Accusing the Song of violating the agreement and realizing the weakness of the Song the Jin generals launched a second punitive campaign again dividing their troops into two armies 37 Wanyan Zonghan who had withdrawn from Taiyuan after the Kaifeng agreement and left a small force in charge of the siege came back with his western army Overwhelmed Taiyuan fell in September 1126 after 260 days of siege 38 When the Song court received news of the fall of Taiyuan the officials who had advocated defending the empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by counselors who favored appeasement 39 In mid December the two Jurchen armies converged on Kaifeng for the second time that year 31 After the defeat of several Song armies in the north Emperor Qinzong wanted to negotiate a truce with the Jin but he committed a massive strategic blunder when he commanded his remaining armies to protect prefectural cities instead of Kaifeng Neglecting the importance of the capital he left Kaifeng defended with fewer than 100 000 soldiers The Song forces were dispersed throughout China powerless to stop the second Jurchen siege of the city 31 The Jin assault commenced in mid December 1126 Even as fighting raged on Qinzong continued to sue for peace but Jin demands for territory were enormous they wanted all provinces north of the Yellow River 40 After more than twenty days of heavy combat against the besieging forces Song defenses were decimated and the morale of Song soldiers was on the decline 41 On January 9 1127 the Jurchens broke through and started to loot the conquered city Emperor Qinzong tried to appease the victors by offering the remaining wealth of the capital The royal treasury was emptied and the belongings of the city s residents were seized 42 The Song emperor offered his unconditional surrender a few days later 43 Qigong the former emperor Huizong and members of the Song court were captured by the Jurchens as hostages 33 They were taken north to Huining modern Harbin where they were stripped of their royal privileges and reduced to commoners 44 The former emperors were humiliated by their captors They were mocked with disparaging titles like Muddled Virtue and Double Muddled In 1128 Jin made them perform a ritual meant for war criminals 45 The harsh treatment of the Song royalty softened after the death of Huizong in 1135 Titles were granted to the deceased monarch and his son Qinzong was promoted to Duke a position with a salary 46 Many factors contributed to the Song s repeated military blunders and subsequent loss of northern China to the Jurchens Traditional accounts of Song history held the venality of Huizong s imperial court responsible for the decline of the dynasty 47 These narratives condemned Huizong and his officials for their moral failures 48 Early Song emperors were eager to enact political reforms and revive the ethical framework of Confucianism but the enthusiasm for reforms gradually died after the reformist Wang Anshi s expulsion as chancellor in 1076 49 Corruption marred the reign of Huizong who was more skilled as a painter than as a ruler Huizong was known for his extravagance and funded the costly construction of gardens and temples while rebellions threatened the state s grip on power 50 A modern analysis by Ari Daniel Levine places more of the blame on deficiencies in the military and bureaucratic leadership The loss of northern China was not inevitable 47 The military was overextended by a government too assured of its own military prowess Huizong diverted the state s resources to failed wars against the Western Xia The Song insistence on a greater share of Liao territory only succeeded in provoking their Jin allies 51 Song diplomatic oversights underestimated Jin and allowed the unimpeded rise of Jurchen military power 52 The state had plentiful resources with the exception of horses but managed its assets poorly during battles 53 Unlike the expansive Han and Tang empires that preceded the Song the Song did not have a significant foothold in Central Asia where a large proportion of its horses could be bred or procured 54 As Song general Li Gang noted without a consistent supply of horses the dynasty was at a significant disadvantage against Jurchen cavalry Jin were victorious only because they used iron shielded cavalry while we opposed them with foot soldiers It is only to be expected that our soldiers were scattered and dispersed 55 The Jin leadership had not expected or desired the fall of the Song dynasty Their intention was to weaken the Song in order to demand more tribute and they were unprepared for the magnitude of their victory 56 The Jurchens were preoccupied with strengthening their rule over the areas once controlled by Liao Instead of continuing their invasion of the Song an empire with a military that outnumbered their own they adopted the strategy of using Chinese to control the Chinese 57 The Jin hoped a proxy state would be capable of administering northern China and collecting the annual indemnity without requiring Jurchen interventions to quell anti Jin uprisings 56 In 1127 the Jurchens installed a former Song official Zhang Bangchang 張邦昌 1081 1127 as puppet emperor of the newly established Da Chu Great Chu dynasty 58 The puppet government did not deter the resistance in northern China but the insurgents were motivated by their anger towards the Jurchens looting rather than by a sense of loyalty towards the inept Song court 56 A number of Song commanders stationed in towns scattered across northern China retained their allegiance to the Song and armed volunteers organized militias opposed to the Jurchen military presence The insurgency hampered the ability of the Jin to exert control over the north 59 Meanwhile one Song prince Zhao Gou had escaped capture 60 He had been held up in Cizhou while on a diplomatic mission and never made it back to Kaifeng He was not present in the capital when the city fell to the Jurchens 61 The future Emperor Gaozong managed to evade the Jurchen troops tailing him by moving from one province to the next traveling across Hebei Henan and Shandong The Jurchens tried to lure him back to Kaifeng where they could finally capture him but did not succeed 62 Zhao Gou finally arrived in the Song Southern Capital at Yingtianfu 應天府 modern Shangqiu in early June 1127 61 For Gaozong r 1127 1162 Yingtianfu was the first in a series of temporary capitals called xingzai 行在 63 The court moved to Yingtianfu because of its historical importance to Emperor Taizu of Song the founder of the dynasty who had previously served in that city as a military governor The symbolism of the city was meant to secure the political legitimacy of the new emperor who was enthroned there on June 12 64 After reigning for barely one month Zhang Bangchang was persuaded by the Song to step down as emperor of the Great Chu and to recognize the legitimacy of the Song imperial line 61 Li Gang pressured Gaozong to execute Zhang for betraying the Song 65 The emperor relented and Zhang was coerced into suicide 58 The killing of Zhang showed that the Song was willing to provoke the Jin and that the Jin had yet to solidify their control over the newly conquered territories 66 The submission and abolition of Chu meant that Kaifeng was now back under Song control Zong Ze 宗澤 1059 1128 the Song general responsible for fortifying Kaifeng entreated Gaozong to move the court back to the city but Gaozong refused and retreated south 67 The southward move marked the end of the Northern Song and the beginning of the Southern Song era of Chinese history 1 The descendant of Confucius at Qufu the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou while the newly established Jin dynasty 1115 1234 in the north appointed Kong Duanyou s brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng 68 Zhang Xuan 張選 a great grandson of Zhang Zai also fled south with Gaozong The Song disbandment of the Great Chu and execution of Zhang Bangchang antagonized the Jurchens and violated the treaty that the two parties had negotiated The Jin renewed their attacks on the Song and quickly reconquered much of northern China 65 In late 1127 Gaozong moved his court further south from Yingtianfu to Yangzhou south of the Huai River and north of the Yangtze River by sailing down the Grand Canal 69 The court spent over a year in the city 70 When the Jurchens advanced to the Huai River the court was partially evacuated to Hangzhou in 1129 67 Days later Gaozong narrowly escaped on horseback just a few hours ahead of Jurchen vanguard troops 70 After a coup in Hangzhou almost dethroned him in May 1129 he moved his capital back north to Jiankang modern Nanjing on the south bank of the Yangtze 71 One month later however Zong Ze s successor Du Chong 杜充 vacated his forces from Kaifeng exposing Jiankang to attack The emperor moved back to Hangzhou in September leaving Jiankang in Du Chong s hands 72 The Jin eventually captured Kaifeng in early 1130 73 From 1127 to 1129 the Song sent thirteen embassies to the Jin to discuss peace terms and to negotiate the release of Gaozong s mother and Huizong but the Jin court ignored them 74 In December 1129 the Jin started a new military offensive dispatching two armies across the Huai River in the east and west On the western front an army invaded Jiangxi the area where the Song dowager empress resided and captured Hongzhou 洪州 present day Nanchang 72 They were ordered to retreat a few months later when the eastern army withdrew 73 Meanwhile on the eastern front Wuzhu commanded the main Jin army He crossed the Yangtze southwest of Jiankang and took that city when Du Chong surrendered 72 Wuzhu set out from Jiankang and advanced rapidly to try to capture Gaozong 75 The Jin seized Hangzhou January 22 1130 and then Shaoxing further south February 4 but general Zhang Jun s 1086 1154 battle with Wuzhu near Ningbo gave Gaozong time to escape 76 By the time Wuzhu resumed pursuit the Song court was fleeing on ships to islands off the coast of Zhejiang and then further south to Wenzhou 75 The Jin sent ships to chase after Gaozong but failed to catch him They gave up the pursuit and the Jurchens retreated north 76 After they plundered the undefended cities of Hangzhou and Suzhou they finally started to face resistance from Song armies led by Yue Fei and Han Shizhong 76 The latter even inflicted a major defeat on Jurchen forces and tried to prevent Wuzhu from crossing back to the north bank of the Yangtze The small boats of the Jin army were outmatched by Han Shizhong s fleet of seagoing vessels Wuzhu eventually managed to cross the river when he had his troops use incendiary arrows to neutralize Han s ships by burning their sails Wuzhu s troops came back south of the Yangtze one last time to Jiankang which they pillaged and then headed north Yet the Jin had been caught off guard by the strength of the Song navy and Wuzhu never tried to cross the Yangtze River again 76 In early 1131 Jin armies between the Huai and the Yangtze were repelled by bandits loyal to the Song Zhang Rong 張榮 the leader of the bandits was given a government position for his victory against the Jin 73 After the Jin incursion that almost captured Gaozong the sovereign ordered pacification commissioner Zhang Jun 1097 1164 who was in charge of Shaanxi and Sichuan in the far west to attack the Jin there to relieve pressure on the court Zhang put together a large army but was defeated by Wuzhu near Xi an in late 1130 Wuzhu advanced further west into Gansu and drove as far south as Jiezhou 階州 modern Wudu 77 The most important battles between Jin and Song in 1131 and 1132 took place in Shaanxi Gansu and Sichuan The Jin lost two battles at Heshang Yuan in 1131 After failing to enter Sichuan Wuzhu retreated to Yanjing He returned to the western front again from 1132 to 1134 The Jin attacked Hubei and Shaanxi in 1132 Wuzhu captured Heshang Yuan in 1133 but his advance was halted by a defeat at Xianren Pass He gave up on taking Sichuan and no more major battles were fought between the Jin and Song for the rest of the decade 77 The Song court returned to Hangzhou in 1133 and the city was renamed Lin an 78 The imperial ancestral temple was built in Lin an later that same year a sign that the court had in practice established Lin an as the Song capital without a formal declaration 79 It was treated as a temporary capital 80 Between 1130 and 1137 the court would sporadically move to Jiankang and back to Lin an There were proposals to make Jiankang the new capital but Lin an won out because the court considered it a more secure city 81 The natural barriers that surrounded Lin an including lakes and rice paddies made it more difficult for the Jurchen cavalry to breach its fortifications 82 Access to the sea made it easier to retreat from the city 83 In 1138 Gaozong officially declared Lin an the capital of the dynasty but the label of temporary capital would still be in place 84 Lin an would remain the capital of the Southern Song for the next 150 years growing into a major commercial and cultural center 85 Qin Hui an official of the Song court recommended a peaceful solution to the conflict in 1130 saying that If it is desirable that there will be no more conflicts under Heaven it is necessary for the southerners to stay in the south and the northerners in the north 86 Gaozong who considered himself a northerner initially rejected the proposal There were gestures toward peace in 1132 when the Jin freed an imprisoned Song diplomat and in 1133 when the Song offered to become a Jin vassal but a treaty never materialized 87 The Jin requirement that the border between the two states be moved south from the Huai River to the Yangtze was too large of a hurdle for the two sides to reach an agreement 88 The continuing insurgency of anti Jin forces in northern China hampered the Jurchen campaigns south of the Yangtze Reluctant to let the war drag on the Jin decided to create Da Qi the Great Qi their second attempt at a puppet state in northern China 59 The Jurchens believed that this state nominally ruled by someone of Han Chinese descent would be able to attract the allegiance of disaffected members of the insurgency The Jurchens also suffered from a shortage of skilled manpower and controlling the entirety of northern China was not administratively feasible 59 In the final months of 1129 Liu Yu 劉豫 1073 1143 won the favor of the Jin emperor Taizong 59 Liu was a Song official from Hebei who had been a prefect of Jinan in Shandong before his defection to the Jin in 1128 59 Da Qi was formed late in 1130 and the Jin enthroned Liu as its emperor 73 Daming in Hebei was the first capital of Qi before its move to Kaifeng former capital of the Northern Song 89 The Qi government instituted military conscription made an attempt at reforming the bureaucracy and enacted laws that enforced the collection of high taxes 45 It was also responsible for supplying a large portion of the troops that fought the Song in the seven years following its creation 74 The Jin granted Qi more autonomy than the first puppet government of Chu but Liu Yu was obligated to obey the orders of the Jurchen generals 74 With Jin support Da Qi invaded the Song in November 1133 Li Cheng a Song turncoat who had joined the Qi led the campaign Xiangyang and nearby prefectures fell to his army The capture of Xiangyang on the Han River gave the Jurchens a passage into the central valley of the Yangtze River 88 Their southward push was halted by the general Yue Fei 45 In 1134 Yue Fei defeated Li and retook Xiangyang and its surrounding prefectures Later that year however Qi and Jin initiated a new offensive further east along the Huai River For the first time Gaozong issued an edict officially condemning Da Qi 88 The armies of Qi and Jin won a series of victories in the Huai valley but were repelled by Han Shizhong near Yangzhou and by Yue Fei at Luzhou 廬州 modern Hefei 90 Their sudden withdrawal in 1135 in response to the death of Jin Emperor Taizong gave the Song time to regroup 90 The war recommenced in late 1136 when Da Qi attacked the Huainan circuits of the Song Qi lost a battle at Outang 藕塘 in modern Anhui against a Song army led by Yang Qizhong 楊沂中 1102 1166 The victory boosted Song morale and the military commissioner Zhang Jun 1097 1164 convinced Gaozong to begin plans for a counterattack Gaozong first agreed but he abandoned the counteroffensive when an officer named Li Qiong 酈瓊 killed his superior official and defected to the Jin with tens of thousands of soldiers 91 Meanwhile Emperor Xizong r 1135 1150 inherited the Jin throne from Taizong and pushed for peace 92 He and his generals were disappointed with Liu Yu s military failures and believed that Liu was secretly conspiring with Yue Fei 92 In late 1137 the Jin reduced Liu Yu s title to that of a prince and abolished the state of Qi 45 The Jin and Song renewed the negotiations towards peace 92 Gaozong promoted Qin Hui in 1138 and put him in charge of deliberations with the Jin 92 Yue Fei Han Shizhong and a large number of officials at court criticized the peace overtures 93 Aided by his control of the Censorate Qin purged his enemies and continued negotiations In 1138 the Jin and Song agreed to a treaty that designated the Yellow River as border between the two states and recognized Gaozong as a subject of the Jin But because there remained opposition to the treaty in both the courts of the Jin and Song the treaty never came into effect 94 A Jurchen army led by Wuzhu invaded in early 1140 94 The Song counteroffensive that followed achieved large territorial gains 95 Song general Liu Qi 劉錡 won a battle against Wuzhu at Shunchang modern Fuyang in Anhui 94 Yue Fei was assigned to head the Song forces defending the Huainan region Instead of advancing to Huainan however Wuzhu retreated to Kaifeng and Yue s army followed him into Jin territory disobeying an order by Gaozong that forbade Yue from going on the offensive Yue captured Zhengzhou and sent soldiers across the Yellow River to stir up a peasant rebellion against the Jin On July 8 1140 at the Battle of Yancheng Wuzhu launched a surprise attack on Song forces with an army of 100 000 infantry and 15 000 horsemen Yue Fei directed his cavalry to attack the Jurchen soldiers and won a decisive victory He continued on to Henan where he recaptured Zhengzhou and Luoyang Later in 1140 Yue was forced to withdraw after the emperor ordered him to return to the Song court 96 Emperor Gaozong supported settling a peace treaty with the Jurchens and sought to rein in the assertiveness of the military The military expeditions of Yue Fei and other generals were an obstacle to peace negotiations 97 The government weakened the military by rewarding Yue Fei Han Shizhong and Zhang Jun 1086 1154 with titles that relieved them of their command over the Song armies 94 Han Shizhong a critic of the treaty retired 98 Yue Fei also announced his resignation as an act of protest 97 In 1141 Qin Hui had him imprisoned for insubordination Charged with treason Yue Fei was poisoned in jail on Qin s orders in early 1142 Jurchen diplomatic pressure during the peace talks may have played a role but Qin Hui s alleged collusion with the Jin has never been proven 99 After his execution Yue Fei s reputation for defending the Southern Song grew to that of a national folk hero 100 Qin Hui was denigrated by later historians who accused him of betraying the Song 101 The real Yue Fei differed from the later myths based on his exploits 102 Contrary to traditional legends Yue was only one of many generals who fought against the Jin in northern China 103 Traditional accounts have also blamed Gaozong for Yue Fei s execution and submitting to the Jin 104 Qin Hui in a reply to Gaozong s gratitude for the success of the peace negotiations told the emperor that the decision to make peace was entirely Your Majesty s Your servant only carried it out what achievement was there in this for me 105 On October 11 1142 after about a year of negotiations the Treaty of Shaoxing was ratified ending the conflict between the Jin and the Song 106 By the terms of the treaty the Huai River north of the Yangtze was designated as the boundary between the two states The Song agreed to pay a yearly tribute of 250 000 taels of silver and 250 000 packs of silk to the Jin 107 The treaty reduced the Southern Song Dynasty status to that of a Jin vassal The document designated the Song as the insignificant state while the Jin was recognized as the superior state The text of the treaty has not survived in Chinese records a clear sign of its humiliating reputation The contents of the agreement were recovered from a Jurchen biography Once the treaty had been settled the Jurchens retreated north and trade resumed between the two empires 108 The peace ensured by the Treaty of Shaoxing lasted for the next 70 years but was interrupted twice One military campaign was initiated by the Song and the other by the Jin 109 Wanyan Liang led a coup against Emperor Xizong and became fourth emperor of the Jin dynasty in 1150 110 Wanyan Liang presented himself as a Chinese emperor and planned to unite China by conquering the Song In 1158 Wanyan Liang provided a casus belli by announcing that the Song had broken the 1142 peace treaty by acquiring horses 111 He instituted an unpopular draft that was the source of widespread unrest in the empire Anti Jin revolts erupted among the Khitans and in Jin provinces bordering the Song Wanyan Liang did not allow dissent and opposition to the war was severely punished 112 The Song had been notified beforehand of Wanyan Liang s plan They prepared by securing their defenses along the border mainly near the Yangtze River but were hampered by Emperor Gaozong s indecisiveness 113 Gaozong s desire for peace made him averse to provoking the Jin 114 Wanyan Liang began the invasion in 1161 without formally declaring war 115 Jurchen armies personally led by Wanyan Liang left Kaifeng on October 15 reached the Huai River border on October 28 and marched in the direction of the Yangtze The Song lost the Huai to the Jurchens but captured a few Jin prefectures in the west slowing the Jurchen advance 115 A group of Jurchen generals were sent to cross the Yangtze near the city of Caishi south of Ma anshan in modern Anhui while Wanyan Liang established a base near Yangzhou 116 The Song official Yu Yunwen was in command of the army defending the river 117 The Jurchen army was defeated while attacking Caishi between November 26 and 27 during the Battle of Caishi 116 The paddle wheel ships of the Song navy armed with trebuchets that fired gunpowder bombs overwhelmed the light ships of the Jin fleet 118 Jin ships were unable to compete because they were smaller and hastily constructed 117 The bombs launched by the Song contained mixtures of gunpowder lime scraps of iron and a poison that was likely arsenic 119 Traditional Chinese accounts consider this the turning point of the war characterizing it as a military upset that secured southern China from the northern invaders The significance of the battle is said to have rivaled a similarly revered victory at the Battle of Fei River in the 4th century Contemporaneous Song accounts claimed that the 18 000 Song soldiers commanded by Yu Yunwen and tasked with defending Caishi were able to defeat the invading Jurchen army of 400 000 soldiers Modern historians are more skeptical and consider the Jurchen numbers an exaggeration Song historians may have confused the number of Jurchen soldiers at the Battle of Caishi with the total number of soldiers under the command of Wanyan Liang The conflict was not the one sided battle that traditional accounts imply and the Song had numerous advantages over the Jin The Song fleet was larger than the Jin s and the Jin were unable to use their greatest asset cavalry in a naval battle 116 A modern analysis of the battlefield has shown that it was a minor battle although the victory did boost Song morale The Jin lost but only suffered about 4 000 casualties and the battle was not fatal to the Jurchen war effort 116 It was Wanyan Liang s poor relationships with the Jurchen generals who despised him that doomed the chances of a Jin victory On December 15 Wanyan Liang was assassinated in his military camp by disaffected officers He was succeeded by Emperor Shizong r 1161 1189 Shizong was pressured into ending the unpopular war with the Song and ordered the withdrawal of Jin forces in 1162 120 Emperor Gaozong retired from the throne that same year His mishandling of the war with Wanyan Liang was one of many reasons for his abdication 121 Skirmishes between the Song and Jin continued along the border but subsided in 1165 after the negotiation of a peace treaty There were no major territorial changes The treaty dictated that the Song still had to pay the annual indemnity but the indemnity was renamed from tribute which had implied a subordinate relationship to payment 122 The Jin were weakened by the pressure of the rising Mongols to the north a series of floods culminating in a Yellow River flood in 1194 that devastated Hebei and Shandong in northern China and the droughts and swarming locusts that plagued the south near the Huai 123 The Song were informed of the Jurchen predicament by their ambassadors who traveled twice a year to the Jin capital and started provoking their northern neighbor The hostilities were instigated by chancellor Han Tuozhou 124 The Song Emperor Ningzong r 1194 1224 took little interest in the war effort 125 Under Han Tuozhou s supervision preparations for the war proceeded gradually and cautiously 126 The court venerated the irredentist hero Yue Fei and Han orchestrated the publishing of historical records that justified war with the Jin 126 From 1204 onwards Chinese armed groups raided Jurchen settlements 124 Han Tuozhou was designated the head of national security in 1205 The Song funded insurgents in the north that professed loyalist sympathies 126 These early clashes continued to escalate partly abetted by revanchist Song officials and war against the Jin was officially declared on June 14 1206 124 The document that announced the war claimed the Jin lost the Mandate of Heaven a sign that they were unfit to rule and called for an insurrection of Han Chinese against the Jin state 127 Song armies led by general Bi Zaiyu 畢再遇 d 1217 captured the barely defended border city of Sizhou 泗州 on the north bank of the Huai River across from modern Xuyi County but suffered large losses against the Jurchens in Hebei 128 The Jin repelled the Song and moved south to besiege the Song town of Chuzhou 楚州 on the Grand Canal just south of the Huai River Bi defended the town and the Jurchens withdrew from the siege after three months 129 By the fall of 1206 however the Jurchens had captured multiple towns and military bases 130 The Jin initiated an offensive against Song prefectures in the central front of the war capturing Zaoyang and Guanghua 光化 on the Han River near modern Laohekou 131 By the fall of 1206 the Song offensive had already failed disastrously 132 Soldier morale sank as weather conditions worsened supplies ran out and hunger spread forcing many to desert The massive defections of Han Chinese in northern China that the Song had expected never materialized 130 A notable betrayal did occur on the Song side however Wu Xi 吳曦 d 1207 the governor general of Sichuan defected to the Jin in December 1206 130 The Song had depended on Wu s success in the west to divert Jin soldiers away from the eastern front 133 He had attacked Jin positions earlier in 1206 but his army of about 50 000 men had been repelled 134 Wu s defection could have meant the loss of the entire western front of the war but Song loyalists assassinated Wu on March 29 1207 before Jin troops could take control of the surrendered territories 135 An Bing 安丙 d 1221 was given Wu Xi s position but the cohesion of Song forces in the west fell apart after Wu s demise and commanders turned on each other in the ensuing infighting 136 Fighting continued in 1207 but by the end of that year the war was at a stalemate The Song was now on the defensive while the Jin failed to make gains in Song territory 132 The failure of Han Tuozhou s aggressive policies led to his demise On December 15 1207 Han was beaten to death by the Imperial Palace Guards His accomplice Su Shidan 蘇師旦 was executed and other officials connected to Han were dismissed or exiled 137 Since neither combatant was eager to continue the war they returned to negotiations A peace treaty was signed on November 2 1208 and the Song tribute to the Jin was reinstated The Song annual indemnity increased by 50 000 taels of silver and 50 000 packs of fabric 138 The treaty also stipulated that the Song had to present to the Jin the head of Han Tuozhou who the Jin held responsible for starting the war 138 The heads of Han and Su were severed from their exhumed corpses exhibited to the public then delivered to the Jin 139 The Mongols a nomadic confederation had unified in the middle of the twelfth century They and other steppe nomads occasionally raided the Jin empire from the northwest The Jin shied away from punitive expeditions and was content with appeasement similar to the practices of the Song 109 The Mongols formerly a Jin tributary ended their Jurchen vassalage in 1210 and attacked the Jin in 1211 140 In light of this event the Song court debated ending tributary payments to the weakened Jin but they again chose to avoid antagonizing the Jin 141 They refused Western Xia s offers of allying against the Jin in 1214 and willingly complied when in 1215 the Jin rejected a request to lower the annual indemnity 142 Meanwhile in 1214 the Jin retreated from the besieged capital of Zhongdu to Kaifeng which became the new capital of the dynasty 143 As the Mongols expanded the Jin suffered territorial losses and attacked the Song in 1217 to compensate for their shrinking territory 144 Periodic Song raids against the Jin were the official justification for the war Another likely motive was that the conquest of the Song would have given the Jin a place to escape should the Mongols succeed in taking control of the north 145 Shi Miyuan 史彌遠 1164 1233 the chancellor of Song Emperor Lizong r 1224 1264 was hesitant to fight the Jin and delayed the declaration of war for two months Song generals were largely autonomous allowing Shi to evade blame for their military blunders 145 The Jin advanced across the border from the center and western fronts 145 Jurchen military successes were limited and the Jin faced repeated raids from the neighboring state of Western Xia 144 In 1217 the Song generals Meng Zongzheng 孟宗政 and Hu Zaixing 扈再興 defeated the Jin and prevented them from capturing Zaoyang and Suizhou 146 A second Jin campaign in late 1217 did marginally better than the first 147 In the east the Jin made little headway in the Huai River valley but in the west they captured Xihezhou and Dasan Pass 大散關 modern Shaanxi in late 1217 148 The Jin tried to captured Suizhou in Jingxi South circuit again in 1218 and 1219 but failed 149 A Song counteroffensive in early 1218 captured Sizhou and in 1219 the Jin cities of Dengzhou and Tangzhou were pillaged twice by a Song army commanded by Zhao Fang 趙方 d 1221 150 In the west command of the Song forces in Sichuan was given to An Bing who had previously been dismissed from this position He successfully defended the western front but was unable to advance further because of local uprisings in the area 151 The Jin tried to extort an indemnity from the Song but never received it 144 In the last of the three campaigns in early 1221 the Jin captured the city of Qizhou 蘄州 in Huainan West deep in Song territory Song armies led by Hu Zaixing and Li Quan 李全 d 1231 defeated the Jin who then withdrew 152 In 1224 both sides agreed on a peace treaty that ended the annual tributes to the Jin Diplomatic missions between the Jin and Song were also cut off 153 In February 1233 the Mongols took Kaifeng after a siege of more than 10 months and the Jin court retreated to the town of Caizhou 154 In 1233 Emperor Aizong r 1224 1234 of the Jin dispatched diplomats to implore the Song for supplies Jin envoys reported to the Song that the Mongols would invade the Song after they were done with the Jin a forecast that would later be proven true but the Song ignored the warning and rebuffed the request 155 They instead formed an alliance with the Mongols against the Jin 154 The Song provided supplies to the Mongols in return for parts of Henan 154 The Jin dynasty collapsed when Mongol and Song troops defeated the Jurchens at the siege of Caizhou in 1234 156 General Meng Gong 孟珙 led the Song army against Caizhou 154 The penultimate emperor of the Jin Emperor Aizong took his own life 157 His short lived successor Emperor Mo was killed in the town a few days later 155 The Mongols later turned their sights towards the Song After decades of war the Song dynasty also fell in 1279 when the remaining Song loyalists lost to the Mongols in a naval battle near Guangdong 158 Jurchen migrants from the northeastern reaches of Jin territory settled in the Jin controlled lands of northern China Constituting less than ten percent of the total population the two to three million ruling Jurchens were a minority in a region that was still dominated by 30 million Han Chinese 1 The southward expansion of the Jurchens caused the Jin to transition their decentralized government of semi agrarian tribes to a bureaucratic Chinese style dynasty 109 The Jin government initially promoted an independent Jurchen culture alongside their adoption of the centralized Chinese imperial bureaucracy but the empire was gradually sinicized over time The Jurchens became fluent in the Chinese language and the philosophy of Confucianism was used to legitimize the ruling government 1 Confucian state rituals were adopted during the reign of Emperor Xizong 1135 1150 159 The Jin implemented imperial exams on the Confucian Classics first regionally and then for the entire empire 160 The Classics and other works of Chinese literature were translated into Jurchen and studied by Jin intellectuals but very few Jurchens actively contributed to the classical literature of the Jin 161 The Khitan script from the Chinese family of scripts formed the basis of a national writing system for the empire the Jurchen script All three scripts were working languages of the government 162 Jurchen clans adopted Chinese personal names with their Jurchen names 163 Wanyan Liang Prince of Hailing r 1150 1161 was an enthusiastic proponent of Jurchen sinicization and enacted policies to encourage it Wanyan Liang had been acculturated by Song diplomats from childhood and his emulation of Song practices earned him the Jurchen nickname of aping the Chinese He studied the Chinese classics drank tea and played Chinese chess for recreation Under his reign the administrative core of the Jin state was moved south from Huining He instated Beijing as the Jin main capital in 1153 Palaces were erected in Beijing and Kaifeng while the original more northerly residences of Jurchen chieftains were demolished 164 The emperor s political reforms were connected with his desire to conquer all of China and to legitimize himself as a Chinese emperor 111 The prospect of conquering southern China was cut short by Wanyan Liang s assassination 120 Wanyan Liang s successor Emperor Shizong was less enthusiastic about sinicization and reversed several of Wanyan Liang s edicts He sanctioned new policies with the intent to slow the assimilation of the Jurchens 122 Shizong s prohibitions were abandoned by Emperor Zhangzong r 1189 1208 who promoted reforms that transformed the political structure of the dynasty closer to that of the Song and Tang dynasties 165 Despite cultural and demographic changes military hostilities between the Jin and the Song persisted until the fall of the Jin 1 In the south the retreat of the Song dynasty led to major demographic changes The population of refugees from the north that resettled in Lin an and Jiankang modern Hangzhou and Nanjing eventually grew greater than the population of original residents whose numbers had dwindled from repeated Jurchen raids 166 The government encouraged the resettlement of peasant migrants from the southern provinces of the Song to the underpopulated territories between the Yangtze and the Huai rivers 166 The new capital Lin an grew into a major commercial and cultural center It rose from a middling city of no special importance to one of the world s largest and most prosperous During his stay in Lin an in the Yuan dynasty 1260 1368 when the city was not as wealthy as it had been under the Song Marco Polo remarked that this city is greater than any in the world 167 Once retaking northern China became less plausible and Lin an grew into a significant trading city the government buildings were extended and renovated to better befit its status as an imperial capital The modestly sized imperial palace was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls 168 The loss of northern China the cultural center of Chinese civilization diminished the regional status of the Song dynasty After the Jurchen conquest of the north Korea recognized the Jin not the Song as the legitimate dynasty of China The Song s military failures reduced it to a subordinate of the Jin turning it into a China among equals 169 The Song economy however recovered quickly after the move south Government revenues earned from taxing foreign trade nearly doubled between the closing of the Northern Song era in 1127 and the final years of Gaozong s reign in the early 1160s 170 The recovery was not uniform and areas like Huainan and Hubei that had been directly affected by the war took decades to return to their pre war levels 171 In spite of multiple wars the Jin remained one of the main trading partners of the Song Song demand for foreign products like fur and horses went unabated Historian Shiba Yoshinobu 斯波義信 b 1930 believes that Song commerce with the north was profitable enough that it compensated for the silver delivered annually as an indemnity to the Jin 172 The Jin Song Wars were one of several wars in northern China along with the Uprising of the Five Barbarians An Lushan Rebellion Huang Chao Rebellion and the wars of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms which caused a mass migration of Han Chinese from northern China to southern China called 衣冠南渡 yì guān nán dù 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 In 1126 1127 over half a million fled from northern China to southern China including Li Qingzhao 182 183 One section of the Confucius family led by Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou moved south to Quzhou with Southern Song emperor Gaozong while his brother Kong Duancao remained behind in Qufu and became the Duke Yansheng for the Jin dynasty A section of the Zengzi family also moved south with the Southern Song while the other part of the Zengzi family stayed in the north However there was also a reverse migration when the war was over of Han Chinese frop the Southern Song towards Jin ruled northern China leading southern China s population to shrink and northern China s population to grow 184 The battles between the Song and the Jin spurred the invention and use of gunpowder weapons There are reports that the fire lance one of the earliest ancestors of the firearm was used by the Song against the Jurchens besieging De an 德安 modern Anlu in eastern Hubei in 1132 during the Jin invasion of Hubei and Shaanxi 186 The weapon consisted of a spear attached with a flamethrower capable of firing projectiles from a barrel constructed of bamboo or paper 187 They were built by soldiers under the command of Chen Gui 陳規 who led the Song army defending De an 188 The fire lances with which Song soldiers were equipped at De an were built for destroying the wooden siege engines of the Jin and not for combat against the Jin infantry 189 Song soldiers compensated for the limited range and mobility of the weapon by timing their attacks on the Jin siege engines waiting until they were within range of the fire lances 190 Later fire lances used metal barrels fired projectiles farther and with greater force and could be used against infantry 187 Early rudimentary bombs like the huopao fire bomb 火礮 and the huopao 火砲 bombs propelled by trebuchet were also in use as incendiary weapons The defending Song army used huopao 火礮 during the first Jin siege of Kaifeng in 1126 191 On the opposing side the Jin launched incendiary bombs from siege towers down onto the city below 192 In 1127 huopao 火礮 were employed by the Song troops defending De an and by the Jin soldiers besieging the city The government official Lin Zhiping 林之平 proposed to make incendiary bombs and arrows mandatory for all warships in the Song navy At the battle of Caishi in 1161 Song ships fired pili huoqiu 霹靂火球 also called pili huopao bombs 霹靂火砲 from trebuchets against the ships of the Jin fleet commanded by Wanyan Liang 193 The gunpowder mixture of the bomb contained powdered lime which produced blinding smoke once the casing of the bomb shattered 194 The Song also deployed incendiary weapons at the battle of Tangdao during the same year 195 Gunpowder was also applied to arrows in 1206 by a Song army stationed in Xiangyang The arrows were most likely an incendiary weapon but its function may also have resembled that of an early rocket 196 At the Jin siege of Qizhou 蘄州 in 1221 the Jurchens fought the Song with gunpowder bombs and arrows The Jin tiehuopao 鐵火砲 iron huopao which had cast iron casings are the first known bombs that could explode The bomb needed to be capable of detonating in order to penetrate the iron casing The Song army had a large supply of incendiary bombs but there are no reports of them having a weapon similar to the Jin s detonating bombs 197 A participant in the siege recounted in the Xinsi Qi Qi Lu 辛巳泣蘄錄 that the Song army at Qizhou had an arsenal of 3000 huopao 火礮 7000 incendiary gunpowder arrows for crossbows and 10000 for bows as well as 20000 pidapao 皮大礮 probably leather bags filled with gunpowder 197
