He earned praise for his efforts in attacking invading Japanese forces before the fall of Singapore and for his dedication in evacuating his men After serving as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1942 44 he was appointed to a senior operational role with the Royal Air Force s 2nd Tactical Air Force in Europe where he saw out the rest of the war Following the end of hostilities McCauley again became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff In 1947 he was promoted to air vice marshal and appointed Chief of Staff at British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters in Japan Returning to Australia in June 1949 he served as the last Air Officer Commanding AOC Eastern Area and the inaugural AOC Home Command now Air Command Raised to air marshal he took up the position of Chief of the Air Staff in January 1954 and was knighted a year later During his tenure in the RAAF s senior role McCauley focused on potential deployments to Southeast Asia particularly Vietnam and threats from the north commencing redevelopment of RAAF Base Darwin and recommending purchase of a light supersonic bomber to replace the Air Force s English Electric Canberra After retiring from military life in March 1957 he chaired various community and welfare organisations serving as Federal President of the Air Force Association for ten years He died in Sydney in 1989 aged 89 Born in Sydney on 18 March 1899 McCauley went to school at St Joseph s College Hunters Hill before entering the Royal Military College Duntroon in 1916 He graduated as a lieutenant in 1919 and spent the next four years in staff positions with the Permanent Military Forces including a posting to Britain 1 2 In January 1924 he transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force as a flying officer undertaking the pilots course at RAAF Point Cook Victoria 3 4 He was nicknamed Black Jack in tribute to his dark looks but a shaky reputation as an aviator also earned him the epithet Crasher 5 6 On 10 November 1925 he married Murielle Burke the couple had a son and two daughters 7 By 1926 McCauley was back in Britain studying at the Royal Naval College Greenwich and the RAF Armament and Gunnery School He returned to Australia in 1928 and was assigned to the staff of RAAF Headquarters Melbourne 1 2 Promoted to squadron leader McCauley was posted a third time to Britain in 1933 graduating from RAF Staff College Andover and qualifying as a flight instructor at Central Flying School Wittering The following year he was attached to the Air Ministry in London 1 8 Returning to Australia in 1935 McCauley joined the RAAF s Directorate of Training That September he initiated a requirement for all air bases to draw up plans for local defence He also inaugurated operational level policy for the Air Force ordering units to draft doctrine relevant to their combat roles such as Striking for No 1 Squadron and Army Co operation for No 3 Squadron Described as a great leader with a great deal of force McCauley took over as Director of Training in 1936 6 He gained his Bachelor of Commerce degree at Melbourne University the same year having studied part time since 1929 1 His tertiary qualification was unusual for a general duties officer in the pre war Air Force whose pilots generally valued little beyond flying ability 9 By 1939 he had been raised to wing commander and was commanding officer and chief flying instructor of the cadet wing at Point Cook 1 10 McCauley s seniority and instructional experience kept him in Australia on training assignments for the first eighteen months of World War II From March to October 1940 he served as the inaugural commander of No 1 Engineering School at Ascot Vale Victoria 1 11 Promoted to group captain he then took over No 1 Service Flying Training School at Point Cook until July 1941 when he handed over to Wing Commander Elwyn King During McCauley s tenure the number of aircraft operated by the school doubled from its initial complement of 52 and monthly flying hours increased from fewer than 1 000 to more than 1 800 12 During the Malayan Campaign in 1941 42 McCauley was in charge of RAAF units under Britain s Far East Air Force FEAF 5 As station commander at RAF Sembawang in north east Singapore from August 1941 13 14 he personally supervised the training and operations of Nos 1 and 8 Squadrons flying Lockheed Hudson light bombers He also warned Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke Popham the FEAF s Commander in Chief of the weaknesses of the Allied air defences 15 16 Deployed to forward bases on the Malay Peninsula McCauley s Hudsons were the first Allied aircraft to spot Japanese troop transports converging off Indochina on 6 December and they attacked the fleet in the face of heavy defensive fire 1 15 By Christmas as the Allies retreated from Malaya Sembawang was the busiest airfield on Singapore island with two Dutch Glenn Martin bomber squadrons in addition to the remnants of the Hudson units along with Nos 21 and 453 Squadrons merged due to losses as No 21 453 Squadron operating obsolescent Brewster Buffalos 8 17 On 29 January 1942 McCauley took over airfield P 2 near Palembang in Sumatra commanding all Commonwealth air operations emanating from the base 8 18 With his available aircraft augmented by Hawker Hurricanes and Bristol Blenheims he conducted attacks on enemy convoys before evacuating the area on 15 February 1942 the day that Singapore surrendered After communications between himself and local RAF group headquarters were cut McCauley was left to his own devices to make final arrangements for the demolition of equipment and departure of staff 15 19 He had earlier intervened to prevent RAF headquarters from dissolving No 21 Squadron and using its personnel as a labour force on Sumatra instead arranging their transport as a unit to Batavia where they subsequently embarked for Australia 20 McCauley led the last party to depart Palembang and was praised for organising the safe passage back to Australia of many Commonwealth air force personnel 8 19 After his return to Australia late in February 1942 McCauley briefly served as Senior Air Staff Officer at North Western Area Headquarters in Darwin Northern Territory He took up the position of Deputy Chief of the Air Staff DCAS in May and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire CBE in the 1943 King s Birthday Honours promulgated on 2 June 1 21 The honour recognised the courage ability and qualities of leadership he displayed under trying and difficult conditions during a period of service in the Far East 22 The following month he was promoted to temporary air commodore 23 During an inspection of No 10 Group at Nadzab in March 1944 McCauley learned that unless the Australian formation was able to increase its operational rate of effort its units would be withdrawn from their forward airfields As a result RAAF Headquarters increased the supply of pilots and equipment to the group which was then able to meet and later exceed the rate of effort achieved by comparable US Fifth Air Force units 24 At around this time he also instigated a research program to determine a suitable formula for rotating and relieving ground staff as well as aircrew in the tropics 25 Completing his term as DCAS McCauley was posted to the European theatre in November 1944 serving for the remainder of the war as Air Commodore Operations 2nd Tactical Air Force RAF 2nd TAF 1 26 The British had actively sought him for this particular appointment which he commenced in December at the formation s Brussels headquarters 27 28 The role involved him in the direction of over 70 Commonwealth and European squadrons in operations against Germany and was unique for an RAAF officer during the war He left 2nd TAF in July 1945 and returned to Australia later that year 27 Among a small coterie of wartime RAAF commanders earmarked for further senior roles McCauley retained his rank of air commodore following the cessation of hostilities 29 30 He served again as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1946 47 26 Promoted to air vice marshal he was Chief of Staff to Lieutenant General Horace Robertson at British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters in Japan from June 1947 to June 1949 In this post he was preceded and succeeded by two other Duntroon graduates Air Vice Marshals Frank Bladin and Alan Charlesworth respectively 1 31 Upon his return to Australia McCauley was made Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area During the Malayan Emergency he formed RAAF aircraft assigned for deployment into No 90 Composite Wing as directed by Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal George Jones to ensure that they would operate with a degree of autonomy rather than be dispersed throughout other Allied groups 32 33 He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath CB in the 1951 Birthday Honours 34 In January 1952 Air Marshal Jones was succeeded by Air Marshal Sir Donald Hardman of the Royal Air Force The decision by Prime Minister Robert Menzies to appoint a British officer as CAS caused controversy in Australia compounded by his stated reason that there was no RAAF officer of sufficient age or operational experience to take the post of Chief of the Air Staff which ignored the wartime records of figures like McCauley 35 Hardman changed the structure of the Air Force from one based on geographical area to one based on function hence McCauley s Eastern Area Command evolved into Home Command now Air Command in 1953 5 36 Promoted to air marshal McCauley took over from Hardman as Chief of the Air Staff when the latter s two year appointment ended in January 1954 According to official RAAF historian Alan Stephens McCauley was just as ready to become CAS in 1952 as he was in 1954 while a contemporary observer declared that seldom has a better equipped officer led a branch of the Australian services 1 5 He was the first of four former Duntroon cadets to successively head up the Air Force between 1954 and 1969 followed by Air Marshals Frederick Scherger Valston Hancock and Alister Murdoch 37 McCauley was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire KBE in the 1955 New Year Honours 38 In October 1956 he gave a presentation on air power concepts that was attended by Prime Minister Menzies as well as the other Australian service chiefs McCauley identified Malaya and Indochina particularly Vietnam as likely areas for future RAAF deployments advocating a continued presence in Singapore in view of its strategic importance to the defence of Australia as he had witnessed first hand during World War II He also recommended that a supersonic light bomber replace the straight winged and obsolescent English Electric Canberra primarily for interdiction in Southeast Asia 5 McCauley s tenure as CAS saw the beginning of a trend for the RAAF to equip with US aircraft types in preference to British types with recommendations being put forward for the F 104 Starfighter though in the event the French Dassault Mirage III was purchased and C 130 Hercules This stemmed partly from his inspection of Allied air force units during the Korean War when he observed that those employing American hardware were far better served with spare parts and replacement aircraft than those with British equipment 39 Some of his senior commanders had urged replacing the Canberra with Avro Vulcan heavy bombers but McCauley did not pursue this option preferring to concentrate in the short term on new fighter technology 40 He also made a point of supporting the Australian aircraft industry wherever feasible 39 41 McCauley instigated the redevelopment of RAAF Base Darwin in the Northern Territory as the first stage of a forward defence strategy He aimed to make Darwin the main Australian base for war and a launching point for deployments to Southeast Asia rather than simply a transit station Over the next ten years No 5 Airfield Construction Squadron transformed the base s runways buildings and other infrastructure into a modern facility capable of handling major operations This concept was taken another step by McCauley s successor as CAS Air Marshal Scherger who conceived a series of front line bare bases across Northern Australia beginning with plans for RAAF Base Tindal in 1959 42 Alan Stephens later described McCauley and Scherger as among the RAAF s better chiefs 43 After his retirement from the RAAF on 18 March 1957 44 McCauley became active in community welfare organisations chairing campaigns for the National Heart Foundation Freedom From Hunger the Royal Humane Society and the Cancer Council in the late 1950s and early 1960s 7 45 From 1964 until 1974 he served as Federal President of the Air Force Association 1 8 In this role he endorsed the initial proposal featuring monumental statues of airmen and ground crew for the Royal Australian Air Force Memorial to be located on Anzac Parade Canberra The design ultimately approved by the final selection panel however was an abstract sculpture that was subsequently described as reflecting a comprehensive failure to understand the nature of air force service 46 McCauley visited RAAF units in Vietnam in October 1966 47 In 1970 he played a leading role in organising the Australian Services Council later the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council to co ordinate lobbying efforts for various veterans groups and became its first chairman 48 He was also President of the Good Neighbour Council of New South Wales from 1966 to 1975 7 McCauley died in Sydney s St Vincent s Hospital on 3 February 1989 following a stroke Aged 89 he was survived by his three children his wife had died two years earlier 2 45 He was buried in Northern Suburbs Cemetery 49
