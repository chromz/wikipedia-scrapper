Supporting operations Aftermath Operation Copperhead was a small military deception operation run by the British during the Second World War It formed part of Operation Bodyguard the cover plan for the invasion of Normandy in 1944 and was intended to mislead German intelligence as to the location of General Bernard Montgomery The operation was conceived by Dudley Clarke in early 1944 after he watched the film Five Graves to Cairo Following the war M E Clifton James wrote a book about the operation I Was Monty s Double It was later adapted into a film with James in the lead role The German high command expected Montgomery one of the best known Allied commanders to play a key role in any cross channel bridgehead Clarke and the other deception planners reasoned that a high profile appearance outside the United Kingdom would suggest that an Allied invasion was not imminent An appropriate look alike was found M E Clifton James who spent a short time with Montgomery to familiarise himself with the general s mannerisms On 26 May 1944 James flew first to Gibraltar and then to Algiers making appearances where the Allies knew German intelligence agents would spot him He then flew secretly to Cairo and remained in hiding until Montgomery s public appearance in Normandy following the invasion The operation did not appear to have any significant impact on German plans and was not reported high up the chain of command It was executed some time before D Day and in the mid of several other Allied deceptions German intelligence might have suspected a trick or not attributed much importance to the visit In preparation for the 1944 invasion of Normandy the Allied nations conducted a complex series of deceptions under the codename Bodyguard The overall aim of the plan was to confuse the German high command as to the exact location and timing of the invasion 1 Significant time was spent constructing the First United States Army Group a notional army to threaten Pas de Calais along with political and visual deceptions to communicate a fictional Allied battle plan 2 Copperhead was a small portion of Bodyguard conceived by Dudley Clarke Earlier in the war Clarke had pioneered the idea of strategic deception forming a deception department in Cairo named A Force Clarke and A Force were not officially in charge of Bodyguard planning a role that fell to the London Controlling Section but because of the location of the deception the Cairo planners organised much of the operation 3 4 On a visit to Naples in January 1944 Clarke had seen the film Five Graves to Cairo in which actor Miles Mander makes a brief appearance as Bernard Montgomery The film involves one character impersonating another and Clarke suggested attempting the same trick in real life He proposed an operation to mislead German commanders as to Montgomery s location in the days immediately before the Normandy landings codenamed Operation Neptune 4 5 Montgomery was one of the most prominent Allied commanders and the German high command expected him to be present for any invasion of France Clarke hoped Montgomery s apparent presence in Gibraltar and Africa would lend support to the idea that the Allies might be planning landings in southern France as part of Operation Vendetta rather than across the Channel While in London in February 1944 Clarke the London Controlling Section and Ops B drafted Copperhead in support of Vendetta 5 Mander the actor from Five Graves to Cairo was located in Hollywood but found to be too tall in real life 4 Another look alike was identified but before he could be drafted into the operation he broke a leg in a motorbike accident Eventually Lieutenant Colonel J V B Jervis Reid head of Ops B spotted a photograph of Meyrick Clifton James in the News Chronicle James an Australian had spent 25 years as an actor before the war and at the time was assigned to the Royal Army Pay Corps Colonel David Niven a well known British actor was asked to contact James and offer him a screen test for future army films When he arrived at the meeting James was told his true role 5 6 James was not a perfect stand in for Montgomery He had lost a finger during the First World War so a prosthetic had to be made He had also never flown before so the London Controlling Section s Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight to make sure he did not suffer from air sickness Finally James both drank heavily and smoked cigars while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking 7 The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking spoiling the performance Despite these hitches and with Montgomery s approval the plan went forward 8 To get into character James spent some time with the general posing as a journalist to study his mannerisms 4 5 Allied deceivers used their double agent network to circulate the idea that Montgomery would command ground forces during the invasion 6 Then on 26 May 1944 James flew overnight from RAF Northolt to Gibraltar where the Germans maintained an observation post overlooking the airport from across the Spanish border The plane had to circle for an hour before landing to allow James who had smuggled a bottle of gin onto the flight to sober up 7 He then attended breakfast with the British governor Sir Ralph Eastwood before departing again for the airfield The Allies had arranged for Ignacio Molina Pérez a Spanish envoy known to be a German spy to visit Government House After observing James s departure Pérez hurriedly crossed the border to place a call to his German handler 4 5 James then flew to Algiers where he was publicly paraded through the airport and driven to meet General Maitland Wilson ostensibly for a meeting to discuss operations against the south of France Instead he was moved quietly to a remote villa by A Force s Rex Hamer Rumours suggest this was because James had been spotted smoking and staggering around Algiers so the deceivers decided to cut his appearances short 7 9 Whatever the reason the next day out of character James was flown to Cairo He was to remain hidden there until the public disclosure of Montgomery s presence in France Meanwhile double agents in North Africa were used to extend the masquerade for a few more days by hinting Montgomery was still in the region 4 5 The impact of Copperhead is unclear The visit was reported up the German chain of command and some double agents later received requests for information about Montgomery s movements 5 There is no indication that Montgomery s appearance affected German views of the imminent invasion threat Writing in 2011 historian Joshua Levine attributes this to the fact that the deception was carried out ten days before D Day arguing that there would be no reason for a flying visit to North Africa to preclude an imminent invasion 10 Another factor was that in early May 1944 an uncontrolled agent based in Spain who sold fictional intelligence to the Germans had passed on details of a meeting in Gibraltar between several high ranking Allied officers Documents found after the war indicate that the Germans found this information suspect and may have treated Montgomery s appearance as equally so 10 Although double agents received several urgent requests from the Abwehr about his whereabouts it does not appear that this information was passed on to the German command in France 5 According to captured enemy generals German intelligence believed that it was Montgomery though they still guessed that it was a feint 11 The Bodyguard deception had confused the German command as to Allied intentions and the apparent arrival of Montgomery in Gibraltar added little to the picture 10 James did not enjoy the experience Although he received equivalent pay 10 per day to Montgomery during the operation it had been a stressful assignment Following Montgomery s public appearance on the Normandy beachhead James flew back to England and resumed his role within the Pay Corps and was warned not to discuss the operation Dennis Wheatley in his memoirs commented that he felt James had been treated shabbily for his efforts 4 5 In 1954 James wrote an account of the operation entitled I Was Monty s Double published in the United States as The Counterfeit General 9 The British government made no attempt to stop publication and in 1958 the book was adapted into a film of the same name 7 James starred as himself alongside John Mills as an intelligence agent 10 12
