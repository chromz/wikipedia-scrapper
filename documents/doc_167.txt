The War of the League of Cambrai sometimes known as the War of the Holy League and by several other names 1 was a major conflict in the Italian Wars of 1494 1559 The main participants of the war fought from 1508 to 1516 were France the Papal States and the Republic of Venice joined at various times by nearly every significant power in Western Europe including Spain the Holy Roman Empire England the Duchy of Milan the Republic of Florence the Duchy of Ferrara and Swiss mercenaries Pope Julius II intending to curb Venetian influence in northern Italy brought together the League of Cambrai an anti Venetian alliance consisting of himself Louis XII of France Ferdinand II of Aragon and Maximilian I the Holy Roman Emperor in December 1508 Although the League was initially successful friction between Julius and Louis caused it to collapse by 1510 Julius then allied himself with Venice against France The Veneto Papal alliance eventually expanded into the Holy League which drove the French from Italy in 1512 disagreements about the division of the spoils however led Venice to abandon the alliance in favor of one with France Under the leadership of Francis I who had succeeded Louis on the throne of France the French and Venetians would through victory at Marignano in 1515 regain the territory they had lost the treaties of Noyon and Brussels which ended the war the next year would essentially return the map of Italy to the status quo of 1508 In the aftermath of the First Italian War 1494 1498 Pope Alexander VI had with French assistance moved to consolidate Papal control over central Italy by seizing the Romagna 2 Cesare Borgia acting as Gonfalonier of the Papal armies had expelled the Bentivoglio family from Bologna which they had ruled as a fief and was well on his way towards establishing a permanent Borgia state in the region when Alexander died on 18 August 1503 3 Although Cesare managed to seize the remnants of the Papal treasury for his own use he was unable to secure Rome itself as French and Spanish armies converged on the city in an attempt to influence the Papal conclave the election of Pius III who soon died to be replaced by Julius II stripped Cesare of his titles and relegated him to commanding a company of men at arms 4 Sensing Cesare s weakness the dispossessed lords of the Romagna offered to submit to the Republic of Venice in exchange for aid in regaining their dominions the Venetian Senate accepted and had taken possession of Rimini Faenza and a number of other cities by the end of 1503 5 Julius II having secured his own control of the Papal armies by arresting and imprisoning Cesare first in Bologna and later in Ravenna quickly moved to re establish Papal control over the Romagna by demanding that Venice return the cities she had seized 6 The Republic of Venice although willing to acknowledge Papal sovereignty over these port cities along the Adriatic coast and willing to pay Julius II an annual tribute refused to surrender the cities themselves 7 In response Julius concluded an alliance with France and the Holy Roman Empire against Venice the death of Isabella I of Castile and the resulting collapse of relations between the parties soon dissolved the alliance but not before Venice had been induced to abandon several of the cities 8 Julius although unsatisfied with his gains did not himself possess sufficient forces to fight the Republic for the next two years he instead occupied himself with the reconquest of Bologna and Perugia which located between Papal and Venetian territory had in the meantime assumed a status of quasi independence 9 In 1507 Julius returned to the question of the cities in Venetian hands once again rebuffed by the Senate he encouraged Emperor Maximilian I to attack the Republic 10 Maximilian using his journey to Rome for the Imperial coronation as a pretext entered Venetian territory with a large army in February 1508 and advanced on Vicenza but was defeated by a Venetian army under Bartolomeo d Alviano 11 A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure Alviano not only routed the Imperial army but also seized the entire County of Gorizia Austrian Istria Merania and the county of Pazin as well as Trieste Fiume and the westernmost portions of Inner Carniola forcing Maximilian to conclude a truce with Venice 12 In the spring of 1508 the Republic provoked Julius by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza in response the Pope called for all Christian nations to join him in an expedition to subdue Venice 13 On 10 December 1508 representatives of the Papacy France the Holy Roman Empire and Ferdinand I of Spain concluded the League of Cambrai against the Republic 14 The agreement provided for the complete dismemberment of Venice s territory in Italy and for its partition among the signatories Maximilian in addition to regaining Gorizia Trieste Merania and eastern Istria would receive Verona Vicenza Padua and the Friuli France would annex Brescia Crema Bergamo and Cremona to its Milanese possessions Ferdinand would seize Otranto and the remainder including Rimini and Ravenna would be added to the Papal States 15 On 9 May 1509 Louis crossed the Adda River at the head of a French army and moved rapidly into Venetian territory 16 To oppose him Venice had hired a condottiere army under the command of the Orsini cousins Bartolomeo d Alviano and Niccol√≤ di Pitigliano but had failed to account for their disagreement on how best to stop the French advance 17 On 14 May Alviano confronted the French at the Battle of Agnadello outnumbered he sent requests for reinforcements to his cousin who replied with orders to break off the battle and continued on his way 18 Alviano disregarding the new orders continued the engagement his army was eventually surrounded and destroyed 19 Pitigliano managed to avoid encountering Louis but his mercenary troops hearing of Alviano s defeat had deserted in large numbers by the next morning forcing him to retreat to Treviso with the remnants of the Venetian army 20 The Venetian collapse was complete 21 Louis proceeded to occupy Venetian territory as far east as Brescia without encountering any significant resistance the Venetians lost all the territory that they had accumulated in northern Italy during the previous century 22 The major cities that had not been occupied by the French Padua Verona and Vicenza were left undefended by Pitigliano s withdrawal and quickly surrendered to Maximilian when Imperial emissaries arrived in the Veneto 23 Julius having in the meantime issued an interdict against Venice that excommunicated every citizen of the Republic invaded the Romagna and captured Ravenna with the assistance of Alfonso d Este Duke of Ferrara 24 D Este having joined the League and been appointed Gonfalonier on 19 April seized the Polesine for himself 25 The newly arrived Imperial governors however quickly proved to be unpopular 26 In mid July the citizens of Padua aided by detachments of Venetian cavalry under the command of the proveditor Andrea Gritti revolted 27 The landsknechts garrisoning the city were too few in number to mount effective resistance and Padua was restored to Venetian control on 17 July 28 The success of the revolt finally pushed Maximilian into action 29 In early August a massive Imperial army accompanied by bodies of French and Spanish troops set out from Trento into the Veneto 30 Because of a lack of horses as well as general disorganization Maximilian s forces were slow to begin the Siege of Padua giving Pitigliano the time to concentrate such troops as were still available to him in the city 31 Although French and Imperial artillery successfully breached Padua s walls the defenders managed to hold the city until Maximilian growing impatient lifted the siege on 1 October and withdrew to Tyrol with the main part of his army 32 In mid November Pitigliano returned to the offensive recapturing Vicenza Este Feltre and Belluno an attack on Verona failed but Pitigliano destroyed a Papal army under Francesco II of Gonzaga in the process 33 Angelo Trevisan organized a river attack on Ferrara by the Venetian galley fleet but the resulting Battle of Polesella ended in another defeat for the Republic when the Venetian ships anchored in the Po River were sunk by Ferrarese artillery 34 Faced with a shortage of both funds and men the Senate decided to send an embassy to Julius in order to negotiate a settlement 35 The terms insisted on by the Pope were harsh the Republic lost her traditional power to appoint clergy in her territory as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venice the Romagnan cities that had prompted the war were to be returned to Julius and reparations were to be paid to cover his expenses in capturing them 36 The Senate argued over the terms for two months but finally accepted them in February 1510 even before the Venetian ambassadors had presented themselves to Julius for absolution however the Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity 37 This apparent reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop multiple French Ferrarese and Imperial armies from invading Venetian territory in May 1510 38 Gianpaolo Baglioni and Andrea Gritti left in command of the Venetian forces by Pitigliano s death in January withdrew to Padua by 24 May the League s armies had taken Vicenza and the Polesine and were advancing on Legnago 39 Gritti fortified Padua for an expected attack by a combined Franco Imperial army but Louis frustrated by Maximilian s failure to appear in person and distracted by the death of his advisor the Cardinal d Amboise abandoned his plans for a siege 40 Julius meanwhile had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy more significantly alienated from Alfonso d Este by friction over a licence for a salt monopoly in the Papal States and Alfonso s continued forays against Venetian forces to secure his recently reacquired Polesine he had formulated plans to seize the Duchy of Ferrara a French ally and to add its territory to the Papal States 41 His own forces being inadequate for the venture the Pope hired an army of Swiss mercenaries ordering them to attack the French in Milan he also invited Venice to ally with him against Louis 42 The Republic facing a renewed French onslaught readily accepted the offer 43 By July 1510 the new Veneto Papal alliance was on the offensive 44 An initial attack on French occupied Genoa failed but Venetian troops under Lucio Malvezzo finally drove the French from Vicenza in early August and a joint force commanded by Francesco Maria della Rovere the Duke of Urbino captured Modena on 17 August 45 Julius now excommunicated Alfonso d Este thus justifying an attack on the Duchy of Ferrara itself in anticipation of his coming victory the Pope traveled to Bologna so as to be nearby when Ferrara was taken 46 The French army however had been left unopposed by the Swiss who having arrived in Lombardy had been bribed into leaving by Louis and was free to march south into the heart of Italy 47 In early October Charles II d Amboise advanced on Bologna splitting the Papal forces by 18 October he was only a few miles from the city 48 Julius now realized that the Bolognese were openly hostile to the Papacy and would not offer any resistance to the French left with only a detachment of Venetian cavalry he resorted to excommunicating d Amboise who had in the meantime been convinced by the English ambassador to avoid attacking the person of the Pope and had thus withdrawn to Ferrara 49 In December 1510 a newly assembled Papal army conquered Concordia and besieged the fortress of Mirandola d Amboise marching to relieve the latter fell ill and died briefly leaving the French in disarray the pope took personal command of the siege and Mirandola fell in January 1511 50 Alfonso d Este meanwhile confronted and destroyed the Venetian forces on the Po River leaving Bologna isolated once more Julius afraid of being trapped by the French departed the city for Ravenna 51 Cardinal Francesco Alidosi whom he left behind to command the defense of the city was no better liked by the Bolognese than Julius himself had been and when in May 1511 a French army commanded by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio approached the citizens of Bologna revolted expelled Alidosi and opened their gates to the French 52 Julius blamed this defeat on the Duke of Urbino who finding this quite unfair proceeded to murder Alidosi in full view of the Papal guard 53 In October 1511 Julius proclaimed a Holy League against France 54 The new alliance included not only Spain and the Holy Roman Empire which abandoned any pretense of adhering to the League of Cambrai in hopes of seizing Navarre from Queen Catherine and Lombardy from Louis but also Henry VIII of England who having decided to use the occasion as an excuse to expand his holdings in northern France concluded the Treaty of Westminster a pledge of mutual aid against the French with Ferdinand on 17 November 55 Louis now appointed his nephew Gaston de Foix to command the French forces in Italy 56 Foix proved more energetic than d Amboise and Trivulzio had been having checked the advance of Ram√≥n de Cardona s Spanish troops on Bologna he returned to Lombardy to sack Brescia which had rebelled against the French and garrisoned itself with Venetian troops 57 Aware that much of the French army would be diverted to deal with the impending English invasion Foix and Alfonso d Este besieged Ravenna the last Papal stronghold in the Romagna in hopes of forcing the Holy League into a decisive engagement 58 Cardona marched to relieve the city in early April 1512 and was decisively beaten in the resulting Battle of Ravenna fought on Easter Sunday the death of Foix during the fighting however left the French under the command of Jacques de la Palice who unwilling to continue the campaign without direct orders from Louis contented himself with thoroughly sacking Ravenna 59 By May 1512 the French position had deteriorated considerably 60 Julius had hired another army of Swiss mercenaries they descended on Milan bringing with them Maximilian Sforza who was determined to regain control of the Duchy for his family 61 The French garrisons abandoned the Romagna where the Duke of Urbino quickly captured Bologna and Parma and retreated to Lombardy attempting to intercept the invasion 62 By August the Swiss had combined with the Venetian army and forced Trivulzio out of Milan allowing Sforza to be proclaimed Duke with their support La Palice was then forced to withdraw across the Alps 63 In late August the members of the League met at Mantua to discuss the situation in Italy and the partition of territory acquired from the French 64 They quickly came to an agreement regarding Florence which had angered Julius by allowing Louis to convene the Council of Pisa in its territory at the Pope s request Ramon de Cardona marched into Tuscany smashed Florentine resistance overthrew the Florentine Republic and installed Giuliano de Medici as ruler of the city 65 On the subject of territory however fundamental disagreements quickly arose 66 Julius and the Venetians insisted that Maximilian Sforza be permitted to keep the Duchy of Milan while Emperor Maximilian and Ferdinand maneuvered to have one of their relatives installed as duke 67 The Pope demanded the annexation of Ferrara to the Papal States Ferdinand objected to this arrangement desiring the existence of an independent Ferrara to counter growing Papal power 68 The Emperor refused to relinquish any Imperial territory which in his eyes included most of the Veneto and signed an agreement with the Pope to exclude Venice entirely from the final partition when the Republic objected Julius threatened to reform the League of Cambrai against her 69 In response Venice turned to Louis on 23 March 1513 a treaty pledging to divide all of northern Italy between France and the Republic was signed at Blois 70 Pope Julius II meanwhile had died in February and Cardinal Giovanni di Lorenzo de Medici second son of Lorenzo the Magnificent and elder brother of the new ruler of Florence was elected Pope Leo X In late May 1513 a French army commanded by Louis de la Tr√©moille crossed the Alps and advanced on Milan at the same time Bartolomeo d Alviano and the Venetian army marched west from Padua 71 The unpopularity of Maximilian Sforza who was seen by the Milanese as a puppet of his Swiss mercenaries enabled the French to move through Lombardy with little resistance Tr√©moille having seized Milan besieged the remaining Swiss in Novara 72 On 6 June the French were attacked by a Swiss relief army at the Battle of Novara and were routed despite having superior numbers 73 Detachments of the Swiss army pursued the fleeing French over the Alps and had reached Dijon before being bribed into withdrawing 74 The rout at Novara inaugurated a period of defeats for the French alliance English troops under Henry VIII besieged Th√©rouanne defeated La Palice at the Battle of the Spurs and captured Tournai 75 In Navarre resistance to Ferdinand s invasion collapsed he rapidly consolidated his hold over the entire region and moved to support another English offensive in the Guyenne 76 James IV of Scotland invaded England at the behest of Louis 77 but he failed to draw Henry s attention from France and his death and the Scots catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513 ended Scotland s brief involvement in the war 78 Meanwhile Alviano unexpectedly left without French support retreated into the Veneto pursued closely by the Spanish army under Cardona while the Spanish were unable to capture Padua in the face of determined Venetian resistance they penetrated deep into Venetian territory and by late September were in sight of Venice itself 79 Cardona attempted a bombardment of the city that proved largely ineffective then having no boats with which to cross the Venetian Lagoon turned back for Lombardy 80 Alviano having been reinforced by hundreds of volunteers from the Venetian nobility pursued Cardona and confronted him outside Vicenza on 7 October in the resulting Battle of La Motta the Venetian army was decisively defeated with many prominent noblemen cut down outside the city walls as they attempted to flee 81 Cardona and Alviano continued to skirmish in the Friuli for the remainder of 1513 and through 1514 82 The death of Louis XII on 1 January 1515 brought Francis I to the throne having assumed the title of Duke of Milan at his coronation Francis immediately moved to reclaim his holdings in Italy 83 By July Francis had assembled an army in the Dauphin√© a combined Swiss and Papal force moved north from Milan to block the Alpine passes against him but Francis following the advice of Gian Giacomo Trivulzio avoided the main passes and marched instead through the valley of the Stura 84 The French vanguard surprised the Milanese cavalry at Villafranca capturing Prospero Colonna 85 meanwhile Francis and the main body of the French confronted the Swiss at the Battle of Marignano on 13 September 86 The Swiss advance initially made headway however Francis s superiority in cavalry and artillery together with the timely arrival of Alviano who had successfully avoided Cardona s army at Verona on the morning of 14 September led to a decisive victory for Francis and the Venetians 87 After the victory at Marignano Francis advanced on Milan capturing the city on 4 October and removing Sforza from the throne 88 In December he met with Leo at Bologna the pope who had in the meantime been deserted by the remainder of his Swiss mercenaries surrendered Parma and Piacenza to Francis and Modena to the Duke of Ferrara 89 In return Leo received guarantees of French noninterference in his proposed attack on the Duchy of Urbino 90 Finally the Treaty of Noyon signed by Francis and Charles V in August 1516 recognized French claims to Milan and Spanish claims to Naples removing Spain from the war 91 Maximilian held out making another attempt to invade Lombardy his army failed to reach Milan before turning back and by December 1516 he had entered into negotiations with Francis 92 The resulting Treaty of Brussels not only accepted French occupation of Milan but also confirmed Venetian claims to the remainder of the Imperial possessions in Lombardy except for Cremona effectively ending the war with a return to the status quo of 1508 93 The peace however would last only four years the growing rivalry between the House of Valois and the House of Habsburg and the election of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 would soon lead to the Italian War of 1521 26 94
