Roman Republic succeeded by Roman Empire and Eastern Roman Empire later Parthian Empire succeeded by Sasanian Empire Roman Sasanian wars Byzantine Sasanian wars The Roman Persian Wars also known as the Roman Iranian Wars were a series of conflicts between states of the Greco Roman world and two successive Iranian empires the Parthian and the Sasanian Battles between the Parthian Empire and the Roman Republic began in 54 BC 1 wars began under the late Republic and continued through the Roman later Byzantine and Sasanian empires Various vassal kingdoms and allied nomadic nations in the form of buffer states and proxies also played a role The wars were ended by the Arab Muslim Conquests which led to the fall of the Sasanian Empire and huge territorial losses for the Byzantine Empire shortly after the end of the last war between them Although warfare between the Romans and Persians continued over seven centuries the frontier aside from shifts in the north remained largely stable A game of tug of war ensued towns fortifications and provinces were continually sacked captured destroyed and traded Neither side had the logistical strength or manpower to maintain such lengthy campaigns far from their borders and thus neither could advance too far without risking stretching its frontiers too thin Both sides did make conquests beyond the border but in time the balance was almost always restored Although initially different in military tactics the armies of both sides gradually adopted from each other and by the second half of the 6th century they were similar and evenly matched 2 The expense of resources during the Roman Persian Wars ultimately proved catastrophic for both empires The prolonged and escalating warfare of the 6th and 7th centuries left them exhausted and vulnerable in the face of the sudden emergence and expansion of the Caliphate whose forces invaded both empires only a few years after the end of the last Roman Persian war Benefiting from their weakened condition the Arab Muslim armies swiftly conquered the entire Sasanian Empire and deprived the Eastern Roman Empire of its territories in the Levant the Caucasus Egypt and the rest of North Africa Over the following centuries more of the Eastern Roman Empire came under Muslim rule According to James Howard Johnston from the third century BC to the early seventh century AD the rival players in the East were grand polities with imperial pretensions which had been able to establish and secure stable territories transcending regional divides 3 The Romans and Parthians came into contact through their respective conquests of parts of the Seleucid Empire During the 3rd century BC the Parthians migrated from the Central Asian steppe into northern Iran Although subdued for a time by the Seleucids in the 2nd century BC they broke away and established an independent state that steadily expanded at the expense of their former rulers and through the course of the 3rd and early 1st century BC they had conquered Persia Mesopotamia and Armenia 4 5 6 Ruled by the Arsacid dynasty the Parthians fended off several Seleucid attempts to regain their lost territories and established several eponymous branches in the Caucasus namely the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia the Arsacid dynasty of Iberia and the Arsacid dynasty of Caucasian Albania Meanwhile the Romans expelled the Seleucids from their territories in Anatolia in the early 2nd century BC after defeating Antiochus III the Great at Thermopylae and Magnesia Finally in 64 BC Pompey conquered the remaining Seleucid territories in Syria extinguishing their state and advancing the Roman eastern frontier to the Euphrates where it met the territory of the Parthians 6 Parthian enterprise in the West began in the time of Mithridates I and was revived by Mithridates II who negotiated unsuccessfully with Lucius Cornelius Sulla for a Roman Parthian alliance c 105 BC 7 When Lucullus invaded Southern Armenia and led an attack against Tigranes in 69 BC he corresponded with Phraates III to dissuade him from intervening Although the Parthians remained neutral Lucullus considered attacking them 8 In 66 65 BC Pompey reached agreement with Phraates and Roman Parthian troops invaded Armenia but a dispute soon arose over the Euphrates boundary Finally Phraates asserted his control over Mesopotamia except for the western district of Osroene which became a Roman dependency 9 The Roman general Marcus Licinius Crassus led an invasion of Mesopotamia in 53 BC with catastrophic results he and his son Publius were killed at the Battle of Carrhae by the Parthians under General Surena 10 this was the worst Roman defeat since the battle of Arausio The Parthians raided Syria the following year and mounted a major invasion in 51 BC but their army was caught in an ambush near Antigonea by the Romans and they were driven back 11 The Parthians largely remained neutral during Caesar s Civil War fought between forces supporting Julius Caesar and forces supporting Pompey and the traditional faction of the Roman Senate However they maintained relations with Pompey and after his defeat and death a force under Pacorus I assisted the Pompeian general Q Caecilius Bassus who was besieged at Apamea Valley by Caesarian forces With the civil war over Julius Caesar prepared a campaign against Parthia but his assassination averted the war The Parthians supported Brutus and Cassius during the ensuing Liberators civil war and sent a contingent to fight on their side at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC 12 After the Liberators defeat the Parthians invaded Roman territory in 40 BC in conjunction with the Roman Quintus Labienus a former supporter of Brutus and Cassius They swiftly overran the Roman province of Syria and advanced into Judea overthrowing the Roman client Hyrcanus II and installing his nephew Antigonus For a moment the whole of the Roman East seemed lost to the Parthians or about to fall into their hands However the conclusion of the second Roman civil war soon revived Roman strength in Asia 13 Mark Antony had sent Ventidius to oppose Labienus who had invaded Anatolia Soon Labienus was driven back to Syria by Roman forces and although reinforced by the Parthians was defeated taken prisoner and killed After suffering a further defeat near the Syrian Gates the Parthians withdrew from Syria They returned in 38 BC but were decisively defeated by Ventidius and Pacorus was killed In Judaea Antigonus was ousted with Roman help by Herod in 37 BC 14 With Roman control of Syria and Judaea restored Mark Antony led a huge army into Atropatene but his siege train and its escort were isolated and wiped out while his Armenian allies deserted Failing to make progress against Parthian positions the Romans withdrew with heavy casualties Antony was again in Armenia in 33 BC to join with the Median king against Octavian and the Parthians Other preoccupations obliged him to withdraw and the whole region came under Parthian control 15 With tensions between the two powers threatening renewed war Octavian and Phraataces worked out a compromise in 1 AD According to the agreement Parthia undertook to withdraw its forces from Armenia and to recognize a de facto Roman protectorate there Nonetheless Roman Persian rivalry over control and influence in Armenia continued unabated for the next several decades 16 The decision of the Parthian King Artabanus III to place his son on the vacant Armenian throne triggered a war with Rome in 36 AD which ended when Artabanus III abandoned claims to a Parthian sphere of influence in Armenia 17 War erupted in 58 AD after the Parthian King Vologases I forcibly installed his brother Tiridates on the Armenian throne 18 Roman forces overthrew Tiridates and replaced him with a Cappadocian prince triggering an inconclusive war This came to an end in 63 AD after the Romans agreed to allow Tiridates and his descendants to rule Armenia on condition that they receive the kingship from the Roman emperor 19 A fresh series of conflicts began in the 2nd century AD during which the Romans consistently held the upper hand over Parthia The Emperor Trajan invaded Armenia and Mesopotamia during 114 and 115 and annexed them as Roman provinces He captured the Parthian capital Ctesiphon before sailing downriver to the Persian Gulf 20 However uprisings erupted in 115 AD in the occupied Parthian territories while a major Jewish revolt broke out in Roman territory severely stretching Roman military resources Parthian forces attacked key Roman positions and the Roman garrisons at Seleucia Nisibis and Edessa were expelled by the local inhabitants Trajan subdued the rebels in Mesopotamia but having installed the Parthian prince Parthamaspates on the throne as a client ruler he withdrew his armies and returned to Syria Trajan died in 117 before he was able to reorganize and consolidate Roman control over the Parthian provinces 21 Trajan s Parthian War initiated a shift of emphasis in the grand strategy of the Roman empire but his successor Hadrian decided that it was in Rome s interest to re establish the Euphrates as the limit of its direct control Hadrian returned to the status quo ante and surrendered the territories of Armenia Mesopotamia and Adiabene to their previous rulers and client kings 22 War over Armenia broke out again in 161 when Vologases IV defeated the Romans there captured Edessa and ravaged Syria In 163 a Roman counter attack under Statius Priscus defeated the Parthians in Armenia and installed a favored candidate on the Armenian throne The following year Avidius Cassius invaded Mesopotamia winning battles at Dura Europos and Seleucia and sacking Ctesiphon in 165 An epidemic which was sweeping Parthia at the time possibly of smallpox spread to the Roman army and forced its withdrawal 23 this was the origin of the Antonine Plague that raged for a generation throughout the Roman Empire In 195 197 a Roman offensive under the Emperor Septimius Severus led to Rome s acquisition of northern Mesopotamia as far as the areas around Nisibis Singara and the 2nd sacking of Ctesiphon 24 A final war against the Parthians was launched by the Emperor Caracalla who sacked Arbela in 216 After his assassination his successor Macrinus was defeated by the Parthians near Nisibis In exchange for peace he was obliged to pay for the damage caused by Caracalla 25 Conflict resumed shortly after the overthrow of Parthian rule and Ardashir I s foundation of the Sasanian Empire Ardashir r 226 241 raided Mesopotamia and Syria in 230 and demanded the cession of all the former territories of the Achaemenid Empire 26 After fruitless negotiations Alexander Severus set out against Ardashir in 232 and finally repulsed him after one column of his army marched successfully into Armenia while two other columns operated to the south and failed mostly on account of physical hardship the emperor celebrated a triumph in Rome 27 In 238 240 towards the end of his reign Ardashir attacked again taking several cities in Syria and Mesopotamia including Carrhae Nisibis and Hatra 28 The struggle resumed and intensified under Ardashir s successor Shapur I he invaded Mesopotamia and captured Hatra a buffer state which had recently shifted its loyalty but his forces were defeated at a battle near Resaena in 243 Carrhae and Nisibis were retaken by the Romans 31 Encouraged by this success the emperor Gordian III advanced down the Euphrates but was defeated near Ctesiphon in the Battle of Misiche in 244 Gordian either died in the battle or was murdered by his own men Philip became emperor and paid 500 000 denarii to the Persians in a hastily negotiated a peace settlement 32 With the Roman Empire debilitated by Germanic invasions and a series of short term emperors Shapur I soon resumed his attacks In the early 250s Philip was involved in a struggle over the control of Armenia Shapur conquered Armenia and killed its king defeated the Romans at the Battle of Barbalissos in 253 then probably took and plundered Antioch 33 Between 258 and 260 Shapur captured Emperor Valerian after defeating his army at the Battle of Edessa He advanced into Anatolia but was defeated by Roman forces there attacks from Odaenathus of Palmyra forced the Persians to withdraw from Roman territory surrendering Armenia and Antioch 34 In 275 and 282 Aurelian and Probus respectively planned to invade Persia but they were both murdered before they were able to fulfil their plans 35 In 283 the emperor Carus launched a successful invasion of Persia sacking its capital Ctesiphon they would probably have extended their conquests if Carus had not died in December of the same year 36 After a brief period of peace during Diocletian s early reign Narseh renewed hostilities with the Romans invading Armenia and defeated Galerius not far from Carrhae in 296 or 297 37 However in 298 Galerius defeated Narseh at the Battle of Satala sacked the capital Ctesiphon and captured the Persian treasury and royal harem The Roman victory was the most decisive for many decades many cities east of the Tigris were given to the Romans including Tigranokert Saird Martyropolis Balalesa Moxos Daudia and Arzan Also control of Armenia was given to the Romans 38 The Emperor Carus launched a successful invasion of Persia in 283 sacking the Sasanian capital Ctesiphon for the third time The Persians were weakened by internal strife proceeding from dynastic disputes and the Romans probably would have extended their conquests had Carus not died in December of that year 39 His successor Numerian was forced by his own army to retreat being frightened by the belief that Carus had died of a strike of lightning 40 After a brief peace early in Diocletian s reign the Persians renewed hostilities when they invaded Armenia and defeated the Romans outside Carrhae in either 296 or 297 41 However Galerius crushed the Persians in the Battle of Satala in 298 capturing the treasury and the royal harem The resulting peace settlement gave the Romans control of the area between the Tigris and the Greater Zab This was the most decisive Roman victory for many decades all the territories that had been lost all the debatable lands and control of Armenia lay in Roman hands 42 The arrangements of 299 lasted until the mid 330s when Shapur II began a series of offensives against the Romans Despite a string of victories in battle culminating in the overthrow of a Roman army led by Constantius II at Singara 348 his campaigns achieved little lasting effect three Persian sieges of Nisibis in that age known as the key to Mesopotamia 43 were repulsed and while Shapur succeeded in 359 in successfully laying siege to Amida and taking Singara both cities were soon regained by the Romans 41 Following a lull during the 350s while Shapur fought off nomad attacks on Persia s eastern and then northern frontiers he launched a new campaign in 359 with the aid of the eastern tribes which he had meanwhile defeated and after a difficult siege again captured Amida 359 In the following year he captured Bezabde and Singara and repelled the counter attack of Constantius II 44 But the enormous cost of these victories weakened him and he was soon deserted by his barbarian allies leaving him vulnerable to the major offensive in 363 by the Roman Emperor Julian who advanced down the Euphrates to Ctesiphon 45 with a major army Despite victory 46 47 at the Battle of Ctesiphon before the walls Julian was unable to take the Persian capital and retreated along the Tigris Harried by the Persians Julian was killed in the Battle of Samarra during a difficult retreat along the Tigris With the Roman army stuck on the eastern bank of the Euphrates Julian s successor Jovian made peace agreeing to major concessions in exchange for safe passage out of Sasanian territory The Romans surrendered their former possessions east of the Tigris as well as Nisibis and Singara and Shapur soon conquered Armenia abondoned by the Romans 48 In 383 or 384 Armenia again became a bone of contention between the Roman and the Sasanian empires but hostilities did not occur 49 With both empires preoccupied by barbarian threats from the north in 384 or 387 a definitive peace treaty was signed by Shapur III and Theodosius I dividing Armenia between the two states Meanwhile the northern territories of the Roman Empire were invaded by Germanic Alanic and Hunnic peoples while Persia s northern borders were threatened first by a number of Hunnic peoples and then by the Hephthalites With both empires preoccupied by these threats a largely peaceful period followed interrupted only by two brief wars the first in 421 422 and the second in 440 after Bahram V persecuted high ranking Persian officials who had converted to Christianity and the second in 440 when Yazdegerd II raided Roman Armenia 50 The Anastasian War ended the longest period of peace the two powers ever enjoyed War broke out when the Persian King Kavadh I attempted to gain financial support by force from the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I the emperor refused to provide it and the Persian king tried to take it by force 51 In 502 AD he quickly captured the unprepared city of Theodosiopolis 52 and besieged the fortress city of Amida through the autumn and winter 502 503 The siege of the fortress city proved to be far more difficult than Kavadh expected the defenders repelled the Persian assaults for three months before they were beaten 53 In 503 the Romans attempted an ultimately unsuccessful siege of the Persian held Amida while Kavadh invaded Osroene and laid siege to Edessa with the same results 54 Finally in 504 the Romans gained control through the renewed investment of Amida which led to the fall of the city That year an armistice was reached as a result of an invasion of Armenia by the Huns from the Caucasus Although the two powers negotiated it was not until November 506 that a treaty was agreed to 55 In 505 Anastasius ordered the building of a great fortified city at Dara At the same time the dilapidated fortifications were also upgraded at Edessa Batnae and Amida 56 Although no further large scale conflict took place during Anastasius reign tensions continued especially while work proceeded at Dara This was because the construction of new fortifications in the border zone by either empire had been prohibited by a treaty concluded some decades earlier Anastasius pursued the project despite Persian objections and the walls were completed by 507 508 57 The siege of the city proved to be a far more difficult enterprise than Kavadh expected the defenders repelled the Persian assaults for three months before being defeated 58 In 503 the Romans attempted an ultimately unsuccessful siege of the Persian held Amida while Kavadh invaded Osroene and laid siege to Edessa with the same results 59 Finally in 504 the Romans gained the upper hand with the renewed investment of Amida leading to the hand over of the city That year an armistice was agreed to as a result of an invasion of Armenia by the Huns from the Caucasus Negotiations between the two powers took place but such was their distrust that in 506 the Romans suspecting treachery seized the Persian officials Once released the Persians preferred to stay in Nisibis 60 In November 506 a treaty was finally agreed upon but little is known of what the terms of the treaty were Procopius states that peace was agreed for seven years and it is likely that some payments was made to the Persians 61 In 505 Anastasius ordered the building of a great fortified city at Dara The dilapidated fortifications were also upgraded at Edessa Batnac and Amida 62 Although no further large scale conflict took place during Anastasius reign tensions continued especially while work continued at Dara This construction project was to become a key component of the Roman defenses and also a lasting source of controversy with the Persians who complained that it violated the treaty of 422 by which both empires had agreed not to establish new fortifications in the frontier zone Anastasius however pursued the project and the walls were completed by 507 508 60 In 524 525 AD Kavadh proposed that Justin I adopt his son Khosrau but the negotiations soon broke down The proposal was initially greeted with enthusiasm by the Roman emperor and his nephew Justinian but Justin s quaestor Proculus opposed the move 63 Tensions between the two powers were further heightened by the defection of the Iberian king Gourgen to the Romans in 524 525 the Iberians rose in revolt against Persia following the example of the neighboring Christian kingdom of Lazica and the Romans recruited Huns from the north of the Caucasus to assist them 64 To start with the two sides preferred to wage war by proxy through Arab allies in the south and Huns in the north 65 Overt Roman Persian fighting had broken out in the Transcaucasus region and upper Mesopotamia by 526 527 66 The early years of war favored the Persians by 527 the Iberian revolt had been crushed a Roman offensive against Nisibis and Thebetha in that year was unsuccessful and forces trying to fortify Thannuris and Melabasa were prevented from doing so by Persian attacks 67 Attempting to remedy the deficiencies revealed by these Persian successes the new Roman emperor Justinian I reorganized the eastern armies 68 In 528 Belisarius tried unsuccessfully to protect Roman workers in Thannuris undertaking the construction of a fort right on the frontier 69 Damaging raids on Syria by the Lakhmids in 529 encouraged Justinian to strengthen his own Arab allies helping the Ghassanid leader Al Harith ibn Jabalah turn a loose coalition into a coherent kingdom In 530 a major Persian offensive in Mesopotamia was defeated by Roman forces under Belisarius at Dara while a second Persian thrust in the Caucasus was defeated by Sittas at Satala Belisarius was defeated by Persian and Lakhmid forces at the Battle of Callinicum in 531 which resulted in his dismissal In the same year the Romans gained some forts in Armenia while the Persians had captured two forts in eastern Lazica 70 Immediately after the Battle of Callinicum unsuccessful negotiations between Justinian s envoy Hermogenes and Kavadh took place 71 A Persian siege of Martyropolis was interrupted by Kavadh I s death and the new Persian king Khosrau I re opened talks in spring 532 and finally signed the Perpetual Peace in September 532 which lasted less than eight years Both powers agreed to return all occupied territories and the Romans agreed to make a one time payment of 110 centenaria 11 000 lb of gold The Romans recovered the Lazic forts Iberia remained in Persian hands and the Iberians who had left their country were given the choice of remaining in Roman territory or returning to their native land 72 The Persians broke the Treaty of Eternal Peace in 540 AD probably in response to the Roman reconquest of much of the former western empire which had been facilitated by the cessation of war in the East Khosrau I invaded and devastated Syria extorting large sums of money from the cities of Syria and Mesopotamia and systematically looting other cities including Antioch whose population was deported to Persian territory 73 The successful campaigns of Belisarius in the west encouraged the Persians to return to war both taking advantage of Roman preoccupation elsewhere and seeking to check the expansion of Roman territory and resources 74 In 539 the resumption of hostilities was foreshadowed by a Lakhmid raid led by al Mundhir IV which was defeated by the Ghassanids under al Harith ibn Jabalah In 540 the Persians broke the Treaty of Eternal Peace and Khosrau I invaded Syria destroying the great city of Antioch and deporting its population to Weh Antiok Khosrow in Persia as he withdrew he extorted large sums of money from the cities of Syria and Mesopotamia and systematically looted the key cities In 541 he invaded Lazica in the north 75 Belisarius was quickly recalled by Justinian to the East to deal with the Persian threat while the Ostrogoths in Italy who were in touch with the Persian King launched a counter attack under Totila Belisarius took the field and waged an inconclusive campaign against Nisibis in 541 In the same year Lazica switched its allegiance to Persia and Khosrau led an army to secure the kingdom In 542 Khosrau launched another offensive in Mesopotamia and unsuccessfully attempted to capture Sergiopolis 76 He soon withdrew in the face of an army under Belisarius en route sacking the city of Callinicum 77 Attacks on a number of Roman cities were repulsed and the Persian general Mihr Mihroe was defeated and captured at Dara by John Troglita 78 Belisarius recalled from the campaigns in the West to deal with the Persian threat waged an inconclusive campaign against Nisibis in 541 Khosrau launched another offensive in Mesopotamia in 542 when he attempted to capture Sergiopolis 79 He soon withdrew in the face of an army under Belisarius sacking the city of Callinicum en route 80 Attacks on a number of Roman cities were repulsed and Persian forces were defeated at Dara 81 In 543 the Romans launched a force of 30 000 troops commanded by the magister militum of the East Martin for an invasion of Persian controlled Armenia An offensive against Dvin was defeated by a small Persian force at Anglon Khosrau besieged Edessa in 544 without success and was eventually bought off by the defenders 82 The Edessenes paid five centenaria to Khosrau and the Persians departed after nearly two months 82 In the wake of the Persian retreat two Roman envoys the newly appointed magister militum Constantinus and Sergius proceeded to Ctesiphon to arrange a truce with Khosrau 83 In the wake of the Persian retreat Roman envoys proceeded to Ctesiphon for negotiations 84 The war dragged on under other generals and was to some extent hindered by the Plague of Justinian because of which Khosrau temporarily withdrew from Roman territory 85 A five year truce was agreed to in 545 secured by Roman payments to the Persians 86 Early in 548 King Gubazes of Lazica having found Persian protection oppressive asked Justinian to restore the Roman protectorate The emperor seized the chance and in 548 549 combined Roman and Lazic forces with the magister militum of Armenia Dagistheus won a series of victories against Persian armies although they failed to take the key garrison of Petra present day Tsikhisdziri 87 In 551 AD general Bassas who replaced Dagistheus put Abasgia and the rest of Lazica under control and finally subjected Petra demolishing its fortifications 88 In the same year a Persian offensive led by Mihr Mihroe and Khorianes occupied eastern Lazica 89 The truce that had been established in 545 was renewed outside Lazica for a further five years on condition that the Romans pay 2 000 lb of gold each year 90 The Romans failed to completely expel the Sasanian from Lazica and in 554 AD Mihr Mihroe launched a new attack and captured the fortress of Telephis which was commanded by general Martin 91 In Lazica the war dragged on inconclusively for several years with neither side able to make any major gains Khosrau who now had to deal with the White Huns renewed the truce in 557 this time without excluding Lazica negotiations continued for a definite peace treaty 92 Finally in 562 the envoys of Justinian and Khosrau Peter the Patrician and Izedh Gushnap put together the Fifty Year Peace Treaty The Persians agreed to evacuate Lazica and received an annual subsidy of 30 000 nomismata solidi 93 Both sides agreed not to build new fortifications near the frontier and to ease restrictions on diplomacy and trade 94 War broke out again when Armenia and Iberia revolted against Sasanian rule in 571 AD following clashes involving Roman and Persian proxies in Yemen between the Axumites and the Himyarites and the Syrian desert and after Roman negotiations for an alliance with the Western Turkic Khaganate against Persia 95 Justin II brought Armenia under his protection while Roman troops under Justin s cousin Marcian raided Arzanene and invaded Persian Mesopotamia where they defeated local forces 96 Marcian s sudden dismissal and the arrival of troops under Khosrau resulted in a ravaging of Syria the failure of the Roman siege of Nisibis and the fall of Dara 97 At a cost of 45 000 solidi a one year truce in Mesopotamia eventually extended to five years 98 was arranged but in the Caucasus and on the desert frontiers the war continued 99 In 575 Khosrau I attempted to combine aggression in Armenia with discussion of a permanent peace He invaded Anatolia and sacked Sebasteia but to take Theodosiopolis and after a clash near Melitene the army suffered heavy losses while fleeing across the Euphrates under Roman attack and the Persian royal baggage was captured 100 The Romans exploited Persian disarray as general Justinian invaded deep into Persian territory and raided Atropatene 100 Khosrau sought peace but abandoned this initiative when Persian confidence revived after Tamkhusro won a victory in Armenia where Roman actions had alienated local inhabitants 101 In the spring of 578 the war in Mesopotamia resumed with Persian raids on Roman territory The Roman general Maurice retaliated by raiding Persian Mesopotamia capturing the stronghold of Aphumon and sacking Singara Khosrau again opened peace negotiations but he died early in 579 and his successor Hormizd IV r 578 590 preferred to continue the war 102 In 580 Hormizd IV abolished the Caucasian Iberian monarchy and turned Iberia into a Persian province ruled by a marzpan governor 103 104 During the 580s the war continued inconclusively with victories on both sides In 582 Maurice won a battle at Constantia over Adarmahan and Tamkhusro who was killed but the Roman general did not follow up his victory he had to hurry to Constantinople to pursue his imperial ambitions 105 Another Roman victory at Solachon in 586 likewise failed to break the stalemate 106 The Persians captured Martyropolis through treachery in 589 but that year the stalemate was shattered when the Persian general Bahram Chobin having been dismissed and humiliated by Hormizd IV raised a rebellion Hormizd was overthrown in a palace coup in 590 and replaced by his son Khosrau II but Bahram pressed on with his revolt regardless and the defeated Khosrau was soon forced to flee for safety to Roman territory while Bahram took the throne as Bahram VI With support from Maurice Khosrau raised a rebellion against Bahram and in 591 the combined forces of his supporters and the Romans defeated Bahram at the Battle of Blarathon and restored Khosrau II to power In exchange for their help Khosrau not only returned Dara and Martyropolis but also agreed to cede the western half of Iberia and more than half of Persian Armenia to the Romans 107 In 602 the Roman army campaigning in the Balkans mutinied under the leadership of Phocas who succeeded in seizing the throne and then killed Maurice and his family Khosrau II used the murder of his benefactor as a pretext for war and reconquer the Roman province of Mesopotamia 108 In the early years of the war the Persians enjoyed overwhelming and unprecedented success They were aided by Khosrau s use of a pretender claiming to be Maurice s son and by the revolt against Phocas led by the Roman general Narses 109 In 603 Khosrau defeated and killed the Roman general Germanus in Mesopotamia and laid siege to Dara Despite the arrival of Roman reinforcements from Europe he won another victory in 604 while Dara fell after a nine month siege Over the following years the Persians gradually overcame the fortress cities of Mesopotamia by siege one after another 110 At the same time they won a string of victories in Armenia and systematically subdued the Roman garrisons in the Caucasus 111 Phocas brutal repression sparked a succession crisis that ensued as the general Heraclius sent his nephew Nicetas to attack Egypt enabling his son Heraclius the younger to claim the throne in 610 Phocas an unpopular ruler who is invariably described in Byzantine sources as a tyrant was eventually deposed by Heraclius having sailed from Carthage 112 Around the same time the Persians completed their conquest of Mesopotamia and the Caucasus and in 611 they overran Syria and entered Anatolia occupying Caesarea 113 Having expelled the Persians from Anatolia in 612 Heraclius launched a major counter offensive in Syria in 613 He was decisively defeated outside Antioch by Shahrbaraz and Shahin and the Roman position collapsed 114 Over the following decade the Persians were able to conquer Palestine Egypt 115 Rhodes and several other islands in the eastern Aegean as well as to devastate Anatolia 116 117 118 119 Meanwhile the Avars and Slavs took advantage of the situation to overrun the Balkans bringing the Roman Empire to the brink of destruction 120 During these years Heraclius strove to rebuild his army slashing non military expenditures devaluing the currency and melting down Church plate with the backing of Patriarch Sergius to raise the necessary funds to continue the war 121 In 622 Heraclius left Constantinople entrusting the city to Sergius and general Bonus as regents of his son He assembled his forces in Asia Minor and after conducting exercises to revive their morale he launched a new counter offensive which took on the character of a holy war 122 In the Caucasus he inflicted a defeat on an army led by a Persian allied Arab chief and then won a victory over the Persians under Shahrbaraz 123 Following a lull in 623 while he negotiated a truce with the Avars Heraclius resumed his campaigns in the East in 624 and routed an army led by Khosrau at Ganzak in Atropatene 124 In 625 he defeated the generals Shahrbaraz Shahin and Shahraplakan in Armenia and in a surprise attack that winter he stormed Shahrbaraz s headquarters and attacked his troops in their winter billets 125 Supported by a Persian army commanded by Shahrbaraz together with the Avars and Slavs the three unsuccessfully besieged Constantinople in 626 126 while a second Persian army under Shahin suffered another crushing defeat at the hands of Heraclius brother Theodore 127 Meanwhile Heraclius formed an alliance with the Western Turkic Khaganate who took advantage of the dwindling strength of the Persians to ravage their territories in the Caucasus 128 Late in 627 Heraclius launched a winter offensive into Mesopotamia where despite the desertion of the Turkish contingent that had accompanied him he defeated the Persians at the Battle of Nineveh Continuing south along the Tigris he sacked Khosrau s great palace at Dastagird and was only prevented from attacking Ctesiphon by the destruction of the bridges on the Nahrawan Canal Khosrau was overthrown and killed in a coup led by his son Kavadh II who at once sued for peace agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territories 129 Heraclius restored the True Cross to Jerusalem with a majestic ceremony in 629 130 The devastating impact of this last war added to the cumulative effects of a century of almost continuous conflict left both empires crippled When Kavadh II died only months after coming to the throne Persia was plunged into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war The Sasanians were further weakened by economic decline heavy taxation from Khosrau II s campaigns religious unrest and the increasing power of the provincial landholders 131 The Byzantine Empire was also severely affected with its financial reserves exhausted by the war and the Balkans now largely in the hands of the Slavs 132 Additionally Anatolia was devastated by repeated Persian invasions the Empire s hold on its recently regained territories in the Caucasus Syria Mesopotamia Palestine and Egypt was loosened by many years of Persian occupation 133 Neither empire was given any chance to recover as within a few years they were struck by the onslaught of the Arabs newly united by Islam which according to Howard Johnston can only be likened to a human tsunami 134 According to George Liska the unnecessarily prolonged Byzantine Persian conflict opened the way for Islam 135 The Sasanian Empire rapidly succumbed to these attacks and was completely conquered During the Byzantine Arab wars the exhausted Roman Empire s recently regained eastern and southern provinces of Syria Armenia Egypt and North Africa were also lost reducing the Empire to a territorial rump consisting of Anatolia and a scatter of islands and footholds in the Balkans and Italy 136 These remaining lands were thoroughly impoverished by frequent attacks marking the transition from classical urban civilization to a more rural medieval form of society However unlike Persia the Roman Empire ultimately survived the Arab assault holding onto its residual territories and decisively repulsing two Arab sieges of its capital in 674 678 and 717 718 137 The Roman Empire also lost its territories in Crete and southern Italy to the Arabs in later conflicts though these too were ultimately recovered When the Roman and Parthian Empires first collided in the 1st century BC it appeared that Parthia had the potential to push its frontier to the Aegean and the Mediterranean However the Romans repulsed the great invasion of Syria and Anatolia by Pacorus and Labienus and were gradually able to take advantage of the weaknesses of the Parthian military system which according to George Rawlinson was adapted for national defense but ill suited for conquest The Romans on the other hand were continually modifying and evolving their grand strategy from Trajan s time onwards and were by the time of Pacorus able to take the offensive against the Parthians 138 Like the Sasanians in the late 3rd and 4th centuries the Parthians generally avoided any sustained defense of Mesopotamia against the Romans However the Iranian plateau never fell as the Roman expeditions had always exhausted their offensive impetus by the time they reached lower Mesopotamia and their extended line of communications through territory not sufficiently pacified exposed them to revolts and counterattacks 139 From the 4th century AD onwards the Sasanians grew in strength and adopted the role of aggressor They considered much of the land added to the Roman Empire in Parthian and early Sasanian times to rightfully belong to the Persian sphere 140 Everett Wheeler argues that the Sassanids administratively more centralized than the Parthians formally organized defense of their territory although they lacked a standing army until Khosrau I 139 In general the Romans regarded the Sasanians as a more serious threat than the Parthians while the Sasanians regarded the Roman Empire as the enemy par excellence 141 Proxy warfare was employed by both Byzantines and the Sasanians as an alternative to direct confrontation particularly through Arab kingdoms in the south and nomadic nations in the north Militarily the Sasanians continued the Parthians heavy dependence on cavalry troops a combination of horse archers and cataphracts the latter were heavy armored cavalry provided by the aristocracy They added a contingent of war elephants obtained from the Indus Valley but their infantry quality was inferior to that of the Romans 142 The combined forces of horse archers and heavy cavalry inflicted several defeats on the Roman foot soldiers including those led by Crassus in 53 BC 143 Mark Antony in 36 BC and Valerian in 260 AD The Parthian tactics gradually became the standard method of warfare in the Roman empire 144 and cataphractarii and clibanarii units were introduced into the Roman army 145 as a result heavily armed cavalry grew in importance in both the Roman and Persian armies after the 3rd century AD and until the end of the wars 140 The Roman army also gradually incorporated horse archers Equites Sagittarii and by the 5th century AD they were no longer a mercenary unit and were slightly superior individually in comparison to the Persian ones as Procopius claims however the Persian horse archer units as a whole always remained a challenge for the Romans which suggests the Roman horse archers were smaller in numbers 146 By the time of Khosrow I the composite cavalrymen aswaran appeared who were skilled in both archery and the use of lance 147 On the other hand the Persians adopted war engines from the Romans 2 The Romans had achieved and maintained a high degree of sophistication in siege warfare and had developed a range of siege machines On the other hand the Parthians were inept at besieging their cavalry armies were more suited to the hit and run tactics that destroyed Antony s siege train in 36 BC The situation changed with the rise of the Sasanians when Rome encountered an enemy equally capable in siege warfare The Sasanians mainly used mounds rams mines and to a lesser degree siege towers artillery 148 149 and also chemical weapons such as in Dura Europos 256 150 151 152 and Petra 550 551 149 Recent assessments comparing the Sasanians and Parthians have reaffirmed the superiority of Sasanian siegecraft military engineering and organization 153 as well as ability to build defensive works 154 By the beginning of Sasanian rule a number of buffer states existed between the empires These were absorbed by the central state over time and by the 7th century the last buffer state the Arab Lakhmids was annexed to the Sasanian Empire Frye notes that in the 3rd century AD such client states played an important role in Roman Sasanian relations but both empires gradually replaced them by an organized defense system run by the central government and based on a line of fortifications the limes and the fortified frontier cities such as Dara 155 Towards the end of the 1st century AD Rome organized the protection of its eastern frontiers through the limes system which lasted until the Muslim conquests of the 7th century after improvements by Diocletian 156 Like the Romans the Sasanians constructed defensive walls opposite the territory of their opponents According to R N Frye it was under Shapur II that the Persian system was extended probably in imitation of Diocletian s construction of the limes of the Syrian and Mesopotamian frontiers of the Roman Empire 157 The Roman and Persian border units were known as limitanei and marzobans respectively The Sasanians and to a lesser extent the Parthians practiced mass deportations to new cities as a tool of policy not just the prisoners of war such as those of the Battle of Edessa but also the cities they captured such as the deportation of the Antioch s people to Weh Antiok Khosrow which led to the decline of the former These deportations also initiated the spread of Christianity in Persia 158 The Persians seem to have been reluctant to resort to naval action 159 There was some minor Sasanian naval action in 620 23 and the only major Byzantine navy s action was during the Siege of Constantinople 626 The Roman Persian Wars have been characterized as futile and too depressing and tedious to contemplate 160 Prophetically Cassius Dio noted their never ending cycle of armed confrontations and observed that it is shown by the facts themselves that Severus conquest has been a source of constant wars and great expense to us For it yields very little and uses up vast sums and now that we have reached out to peoples who are neighbor of the Medes and the Parthians rather than of ourselves we are always one might say fighting the battles of those peoples 161 In the long series of wars between the two powers the frontier in upper Mesopotamia remained more or less constant Historians point out that the stability of the frontier over the centuries is remarkable although Nisibis Singara Dara and other cities of upper Mesopotamia changed hands from time to time and the possession of these frontier cities gave one empire a trade advantage over the other As Frye states 155 One has the impression that the blood spilled in the warfare between the two states brought as little real gain to one side or the other as the few meters of land gained at terrible cost in the trench warfare of the First World War Both sides attempted to justify their respective military goals in both active and reactive ways According to the Letter of Tansar and the Muslim writer Al Tha alibi Ardashir I s and Pacorus I s invasions respectively of Roman territories were to avenge Alexander the Great s conquest of Persia which was thought to be the cause of the subsequent Iranian disarray 163 164 this is matched by the notion imitatio Alexandri cherished by the Roman emperors Caracalla Alexander Severus 165 and Julian 166 The Roman quest for world domination was accompanied by a sense of mission and pride in Western civilization and by ambitions to become a guarantor of peace and order Roman sources reveal long standing prejudices with regard to the Eastern powers customs religious structures languages and forms of government John F Haldon underscores that although the conflicts between Persia and East Rome revolved around issues of strategic control around the eastern frontier yet there was always a religious ideological element present From the time of Constantine on Roman emperors appointed themselves as the protectors of Christians of Persia 167 This attitude created intense suspicions of the loyalties of Christians living in Sasanian Iran and often led to Roman Persian tensions or even military confrontations 168 e g in 421 422 A characteristic of the final phase of the conflict when what had begun in 611 612 as a raid was soon transformed into a war of conquest was the pre eminence of the Cross as a symbol of imperial victory and of the strong religious element in the Roman imperial propaganda Heraclius himself cast Khosrau as the enemy of God and authors of the 6th and 7th centuries were fiercely hostile to Persia 169 170 The sources for the history of Parthia and the wars with Rome are scant and scattered The Parthians followed the Achaemenid tradition and favored oral historiography which assured the corruption of their history once they had been vanquished The main sources of this period are thus Roman Tacitus Marius Maximus and Justin and Greek historians Herodian Cassius Dio and Plutarch The 13th book of the Sibylline Oracles narrates the effects of the Roman Persian Wars in Syria from the reign of Gordian III to the domination of the province by Odaenathus of Palmyra With the end of Herodian s record all contemporary chronological narratives of Roman history are lost until the narratives of Lactantius and Eusebius at the beginning of the 4th century both from a Christian perspective 171 The principal sources for the early Sasanian period are not contemporary Among them the most important are the Greeks Agathias and Malalas the Persian Muslims al Tabari and Ferdowsi the Armenian Agathangelos and the Syriac Chronicles of Edessa and Arbela most of whom depended on late Sasanian sources especially Khwaday Namag The Augustan History is neither contemporary nor reliable but it is the chief narrative source for Severus and Carus The trilingual Middle Persian Parthian Greek inscriptions of Shapur are primary sources 172 These were isolated attempts at approaching written historiography however and by the end of the 4th century AD even the practice of carving rock reliefs and leaving short inscriptions was abandoned by the Sasanians 173 For the period between 353 and 378 there is an eyewitness source to the main events on the eastern frontier in the Res Gestae of Ammianus Marcellinus For the events covering the period between the 4th and the 6th century the works of Sozomenus Zosimus Priscus and Zonaras are especially valuable 174 The single most important source for Justinian s Persian wars up to 553 is Procopius His continuators Agathias and Menander Protector offer many important details as well Theophylact Simocatta is the main source for the reign of Maurice 175 while Theophanes Chronicon Paschale and the poems of George of Pisidia are useful sources for the last Roman Persian war In addition to Byzantine sources two Armenian historians Sebeos and Movses contribute to the coherent narrative of Heraclius war and are regarded by Howard Johnston as the most important of extant non Muslim sources 176
