Located in the City of Westminster the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning Originally known as Buckingham House the building at the core of today s palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years It was acquired by King George III in 1761 4 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen s House During the 19th century it was enlarged principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore who constructed three wings around a central courtyard Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries including the East Front which contains the well known balcony on which the royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds A German bomb destroyed the palace chapel during World War II the Queen s Gallery was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection The original early 19th century interior designs many of which survive include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis on the advice of Sir Charles Long King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle Époque cream and gold colour scheme Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House The palace has 775 rooms and the garden is the largest private garden in London The state rooms used for official and state entertaining are open to the public each year for most of August and September and on some days in winter and spring In the Middle Ages the site of the future palace formed part of the Manor of Ebury also called Eia The marshy ground was watered by the river Tyburn which still flows below the courtyard and south wing of the palace 5 Where the river was fordable at Cow Ford the village of Eye Cross grew Ownership of the site changed hands many times owners included Edward the Confessor and his queen consort Edith of Wessex in late Saxon times and after the Norman Conquest William the Conqueror William gave the site to Geoffrey de Mandeville who bequeathed it to the monks of Westminster Abbey b In 1531 Henry VIII acquired the Hospital of St James which became St James s Palace 6 from Eton College and in 1536 he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey 7 These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier 8 Various owners leased it from royal landlords and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century By then the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay and the area was mostly wasteland 9 Needing money James I sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a 4 acre 1 6 ha mulberry garden for the production of silk This is at the north west corner of today s palace 10 Clement Walker in Anarchia Anglicana 1649 refers to new erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S James s this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery Eventually in the late 17th century the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir Hugh Audley by the great heiress Mary Davies c Possibly the first house erected within the site was that of a Sir William Blake around 1624 11 The next owner was Lord Goring who from 1633 extended Blake s house and developed much of today s garden then known as Goring Great Garden 12 13 He did not however obtain the freehold interest in the mulberry garden Unbeknown to Goring in 1640 the document failed to pass the Great Seal before King Charles I fled London which it needed to do for legal execution 14 It was this critical omission that helped the British royal family regain the freehold under King George III 15 When the improvident Goring defaulted on his rents 16 Henry Bennet 1st Earl of Arlington was able to purchase the lease of Goring House and he was occupying it when it burned down in 1674 13 following which he constructed Arlington House on the site the location of the southern wing of today s palace the next year 13 In 1698 John Sheffield later the first Duke of Buckingham and Normanby acquired the lease 17 The house which forms the architectural core of the palace was built for the first Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1703 to the design of William Winde The style chosen was of a large three floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings 18 Buckingham House was eventually sold by Buckingham s illegitimate son Sir Charles Sheffield in 1761 4 to George III for 21 000 19 d Sheffield s leasehold on the mulberry garden site the freehold of which was still owned by the royal family was due to expire in 1774 20 Under the new Crown ownership the building was originally intended as a private retreat for King George III s wife Queen Charlotte and was accordingly known as The Queen s House Remodelling of the structure began in 1762 21 In 1775 an Act of Parliament settled the property on Queen Charlotte in exchange for her rights to Somerset House 22 e and 14 of her 15 children were born there Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution 23 of 1789 While St James s Palace remained the official and ceremonial royal residence 22 the name Buckingham palace was used from at least 1791 24 After his accession to the throne in 1820 King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small comfortable home However in 1826 while the work was in progress the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash 25 The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo classical influence preferred by George IV The cost of the renovations grew dramatically and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash s designs resulted in his removal as the architect On the death of George IV in 1830 his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work 26 27 After the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834 William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament 28 Buckingham Palace finally became the principal royal residence in 1837 on the accession of Queen Victoria 29 who was the first monarch to reside there her predecessor William IV had died before its completion 30 While the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious For one thing it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down and consequently the palace was often cold 31 Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled and when it was decided to install gas lamps there was a serious worry about the build up of gas on the lower floors It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty 31 Following the Queen s marriage in 1840 her husband Prince Albert concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff and with addressing the design faults of the palace 32 By the end of 1840 all the problems had been rectified However the builders were to return within the decade 32 By 1847 the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family 33 and consequently the new wing designed by Edward Blore was built by Thomas Cubitt 34 enclosing the central quadrangle The large East Front facing The Mall is today the public face of Buckingham Palace and contains the balcony from which the royal family acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and after the annual Trooping the Colour 35 The ballroom wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period designed by Nash s student Sir James Pennethorne 36 Before Prince Albert s death the palace was frequently the scene of musical entertainments 37 and the most celebrated contemporary musicians entertained at Buckingham Palace The composer Felix Mendelssohn is known to have played there on three occasions 38 Johann Strauss II and his orchestra played there when in England 39 Under Victoria Buckingham Palace was frequently the scene of lavish costume balls in addition to the usual royal ceremonies investitures and presentations 40 Widowed in 1861 the grief stricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham Palace to live at Windsor Castle Balmoral Castle and Osborne House For many years the palace was seldom used even neglected In 1864 a note was found pinned to the fence of Buckingham Palace saying These commanding premises to be let or sold in consequence of the late occupant s declining business 41 Eventually public opinion persuaded the Queen to return to London though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible Court functions were still held at Windsor Castle presided over by the sombre Queen habitually dressed in mourning black while Buckingham Palace remained shuttered for most of the year 42 The front of the palace measures 355 feet 108 m across by 390 ft 120 m deep by 80 ft 24 m high and contains over 830 000 sq ft 77 000 m2 of floorspace 43 There are 775 rooms including 188 staff bedrooms 92 offices 78 bathrooms 52 principal bedrooms and 19 state rooms It also has a post office cinema swimming pool doctor s surgery 44 and jeweller s workshop 45 The principal rooms are contained on the piano nobile behind the west facing garden façade at the rear of the palace The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room its large bow the dominant feature of the façade Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms At the centre of the suite serving as a corridor to link the state rooms is the Picture Gallery which is top lit and 55 yards 50 m long 46 The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by Rembrandt van Dyck Rubens and Vermeer 47 other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase 46 The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in Roman costume set in a tribune lined with tapestries These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining but are open to the public every summer 48 Directly underneath the State Apartments are the less grand semi state apartments Opening from the Marble Hall these rooms are used for less formal entertaining such as luncheon parties and private audiences Some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors such as the 1844 Room decorated in that year for the state visit of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia and the 1855 Room in honour of the visit of Emperor Napoleon III of France 49 At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room through which thousands of guests pass annually to the Queen s garden parties 50 The Queen and Prince Philip use a smaller suite of rooms in the north wing 51 Between 1847 and 1850 when Blore was building the new east wing the Brighton Pavilion was once again plundered of its fittings As a result many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece designed by Robert Jones and sculpted by Richard Westmacott 52 It was formerly in the Music Room at the Brighton Pavilion 52 The ornate clock known as the Kylin Clock was made in Jingdezhen Jiangxi Province China in the second half of the 18th century it has a later movement by Benjamin Vulliamy circa 1820 53 The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons designed by Robert Jones 54 At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre Room behind its glass doors This is a Chinese style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary who working with the designer Sir Charles Allom created a more binding 55 Chinese theme in the late 1920s although the lacquer doors were brought from Brighton in 1873 Running the length of the piano nobile of the east wing is the Great Gallery modestly known as the Principal Corridor which runs the length of the eastern side of the quadrangle 56 It has mirrored doors and mirrored cross walls reflecting porcelain pagodas and other oriental furniture from Brighton The Chinese Luncheon Room and Yellow Drawing Room are situated at each end of this gallery with the Centre Room in between 57 The original early 19th century interior designs many of which still survive included widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis on the advice of Sir Charles Long King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle époque cream and gold colour scheme 58 When paying a state visit to Britain foreign heads of state are usually entertained by the Queen at Buckingham Palace They are allocated an extensive suite of rooms known as the Belgian Suite situated at the foot of the Minister s Staircase on the ground floor of the north facing Garden Wing Narrow corridors link the rooms of the suite one of them is given extra height and perspective by saucer domes designed by Nash in the style of Soane 59 A second corridor in the suite has Gothic influenced cross over vaulting 59 The Belgian Rooms themselves were decorated in their present style and named after King Leopold I of Belgium uncle of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert In 1936 the suite briefly became the private apartments of the palace when King Edward VIII occupied them 44 Investitures which include the conferring of knighthoods by dubbing with a sword and other awards take place in the palace s Ballroom built in 1854 At 120 ft 36 6 m long 60 ft 18 m wide and 45 ft 13 5 m high 44 it is the largest room in the palace It has replaced the throne room in importance and use During investitures the Queen stands on the throne dais beneath a giant domed velvet canopy known as a shamiana or a baldachin that was used at the Delhi Durbar in 1911 60 A military band plays in the musicians gallery as award recipients approach the Queen and receive their honours watched by their families and friends 61 State banquets also take place in the Ballroom these formal dinners are held on the first evening of a state visit by a foreign head of state 61 On these occasions for up to 170 guests in formal white tie and decorations including tiaras the dining table is laid with the Grand Service a collection of silver gilt plate made in 1811 for the Prince of Wales later George IV 62 The largest and most formal reception at Buckingham Palace takes place every November when the Queen entertains members of the diplomatic corps 63 On this grand occasion all the state rooms are in use as the royal family proceed through them 64 beginning at the great north doors of the Picture Gallery As Nash had envisaged all the large double mirrored doors stand open reflecting the numerous crystal chandeliers and sconces creating a deliberate optical illusion of space and light 65 Smaller ceremonies such as the reception of new ambassadors take place in the 1844 Room Here too the Queen holds small lunch parties and often meetings of the Privy Council Larger lunch parties often take place in the curved and domed Music Room or the State Dining Room 66 Since the bombing of the palace chapel in World War II royal christenings have sometimes taken place in the Music Room The Queen s first three children were all baptised there 67 On all formal occasions the ceremonies are attended by the Yeomen of the Guard in their historic uniforms and other officers of the court such as the Lord Chamberlain 66 Formerly men not wearing military uniform wore knee breeches of 18th century design Women s evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers in their hair often both The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed After the First World War when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground she requested a lady in waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the King s reaction King George V disapproved so the Queen kept her hemline unfashionably low 68 Following his accession in 1936 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise Today there is no official dress code 44 Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits 44 a minority wear morning coats and in the evening depending on the formality of the occasion black tie or white tie 69 Débutantes were aristocratic young ladies making their first entrée into society through a presentation to the monarch at court These occasions known as coming out took place at the palace from the reign of Edward VII The débutantes entered wearing full court dress with three ostrich feathers in their hair curtsied performed a backwards walk and a further curtsey while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length The ceremony known as an evening court corresponded to the court drawing rooms of Victoria s reign 70 After World War II the ceremony was replaced by less formal afternoon receptions omitting the requirement court evening dress 71 In 1958 the Queen abolished the presentation parties for débutantes 72 replacing them with Garden Parties f for up to 8 000 invitees in the Garden They are the largest functions of the year 74 The boy Jones was an intruder who gained entry to the palace on three occasions between 1838 and 1841 75 76 At least 12 people have managed to gain unauthorised entry into the palace or its grounds since 1914 77 including Michael Fagan who broke into the palace twice in 1982 and entered the Queen s bedroom on the second occasion At the time news media reported that he had a long conversation with the Queen while she waited for security officers to arrive but in a 2012 interview with The Independent Fagan said the Queen ran out of the room and no conversation took place 78 It was only in 2007 that trespassing on the palace grounds became a specific criminal offence 79 g At the rear of the palace is the large and park like garden which together with its lake is the largest private garden in London 82 There the Queen hosts her annual garden parties each summer and also holds large functions to celebrate royal milestones such as jubilees It covers 40 acres 16 ha and includes a helicopter landing area a lake and a tennis court 44 Adjacent to the palace is the Royal Mews also designed by Nash where the royal carriages including the Gold State Coach are housed This rococo gilt coach designed by Sir William Chambers in 1760 has painted panels by G B Cipriani It was first used for the State Opening of Parliament by George III in 1762 and has been used by the monarch for every coronation since George IV It was last used for the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II 83 Also housed in the mews are the coach horses used at royal ceremonial processions 84 The Mall a ceremonial approach route to the palace was designed by Sir Aston Webb and completed in 1911 as part of a grand memorial to Queen Victoria It extends from Admiralty Arch across St James s Park to the Victoria Memorial This route is used by the cavalcades and motorcades of visiting heads of state and by the royal family on state occasions such as the annual Trooping the Colour 85 In 1901 the accession of Edward VII saw new life breathed into the palace The King and his wife Queen Alexandra had always been at the forefront of London high society and their friends known as the Marlborough House Set were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age Buckingham Palace the Ballroom Grand Entrance Marble Hall Grand Staircase vestibules and galleries redecorated in the Belle Époque cream and gold colour scheme they retain today once again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale but leaving some to feel King Edward s heavy redecorations were at odds with Nash s original work 86 The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when in 1913 Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore s 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni s Lyme Park in Cheshire This new refaced principal façade of Portland stone was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria placed outside the main gates 87 George V who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910 had a more serious personality than his father greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties 88 He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band 1919 the first jazz performance for a head of state Sidney Bechet and Louis Armstrong 1932 which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a Kind of Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom 89 90 King George V s wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art both restoring and adding to it Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed such as the pair of marble Empire style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy dating from 1810 which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room 91 This room 69 feet 21 metres long previously known as the South Drawing Room has a ceiling designed by Nash coffered with huge gilt console brackets 92 During World War I the palace then the home of King George V and Queen Mary escaped unscathed Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in residence The King imposed rationing at the palace much to the dismay of his guests and household 93 To the King s later regret David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further and ostentatiously lock the wine cellars and refrain from alcohol to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence 94 In 1938 the north west pavilion designed by Nash as a conservatory was converted into a swimming pool 95 During World War II the palace was bombed nine times 96 the most serious and publicised incident destroyed the palace chapel in 1940 This event was shown in cinemas throughout the UK to show the common suffering of rich and poor One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth were in the palace and many windows were blown in and the chapel destroyed 97 War time coverage of such incidents was severely restricted however The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home the smiling Queen as always immaculately dressed in a hat and matching coat seemingly unbothered by the damage around her It was at this time the Queen famously declared I m glad we have been bombed Now I can look the East End in the face The royal family were seen as sharing their subjects hardship as The Sunday Graphic reported By the Editor The King and Queen have endured the ordeal which has come to their subjects For the second time a German bomber has tried to bring death and destruction to the home of Their Majesties When this war is over the common danger which King George and Queen Elizabeth have shared with their people will be a cherished memory and an inspiration through the years 98 On 15 September 1940 known as the Battle of Britain Day an RAF pilot Ray Holmes of No 504 Squadron RAF rammed a German Dornier Do 17 bomber he believed was going to bomb the Palace Holmes had run out of ammunition and made the quick decision to ram it Holmes bailed out and the aircraft crashed into the forecourt of London Victoria station 99 The bomber s engine was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London The British pilot became a King s Messenger after the war and died at the age of 90 in 2005 100 On VE Day 8 May 1945 the palace was the centre of British celebrations The King the Queen Princess Elizabeth the future Queen and Princess Margaret appeared on the balcony with the palace s blacked out windows behind them to cheers from a vast crowd in The Mall 101 The damaged Palace was carefully restored after the war by John Mowlem Co 102 It was designated a Grade I listed building in 1970 103 Every year some 50 000 invited guests are entertained at garden parties receptions audiences and banquets Three garden parties are held in the summer usually in July 104 The forecourt of Buckingham Palace is used for the Changing of the Guard a major ceremony and tourist attraction daily from April to July every other day in other months 105 The palace like Windsor Castle is owned by the reigning monarch in right of the Crown It is not the monarch s personal property unlike Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle 106 Many of the contents of Buckingham Palace Windsor Castle Kensington Palace and St James s Palace are part of the Royal Collection held in trust by the Sovereign they can on occasion be viewed by the public at the Queen s Gallery near the Royal Mews Unlike the palace and the castle the purpose built gallery is open continually and displays a changing selection of items from the collection 107 It occupies the site of the chapel destroyed by an air raid in World War II 17 The palace s state rooms have been open to the public during August and September and on some dates throughout the year since 1993 The money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire devastated many of its state rooms 108 In the year to 31 March 2017 580 000 people visited the palace and 154 000 visited the gallery 109 Her Majesty s Government is responsible for maintaining the palace in exchange for the profits made by the Crown Estate 110 In November 2015 the State Dining Room was closed for six months because its ceiling had become potentially dangerous 111 A 10 year schedule of maintenance work including new plumbing wiring boilers and radiators and the installation of solar panels on the roof has been estimated to cost 369 million and was approved by the prime minister in November 2016 It will be funded by a temporary increase in the Sovereign Grant paid from the income of the Crown Estate and is intended to extend the building s working life by at least 50 years 112 113 In March 2017 the House of Commons backed funding for the project by 464 votes to 56 114 Buckingham Palace is a symbol and home of the British monarchy an art gallery and a tourist attraction Behind the gilded railings and gates that were completed by the Bromsgrove Guild in 1911 42 and Webb s famous façade which has been described in a book published by the Royal Collection Trust as looking like everybody s idea of a palace 42 is not only a weekday home of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip but also the London residence of the Duke of York and the Earl and Countess of Wessex The palace also houses their offices as well as those of the Princess Royal and Princess Alexandra and is the workplace of more than 800 people 44 115
