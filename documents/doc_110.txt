the Battle of Port Moresby in 1942 Born in Brisbane he was a grazier and businessman who also operated his own private plane when he joined the Royal Australian Air Force RAAF Reserve in 1936 Called up for active service following the outbreak of war in 1939 Jackson served with No 23 Squadron in Australia before he was posted to the Middle East in November 1940 As a fighter pilot with No 3 Squadron he flew Gloster Gladiators Hawker Hurricanes and P 40 Tomahawks during the North African and Syria Lebanon campaigns Jackson was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and mentioned in despatches for his actions in the Middle East Posted to the South West Pacific theatre he was promoted to squadron leader in March 1942 and given command of No 75 Squadron operating P 40 Kittyhawks at Port Moresby in Papua Described as rugged simple and true as steel 1 Jackson was nicknamed Old John in affectionate tribute to his thirty four years He earned praise for his leadership during the defence of Port Moresby before his death in combat on 28 April His younger brother Les took over No 75 Squadron and also became a fighter ace Jacksons International Airport Port Moresby is named in John Jackson s honour John Jackson was born on 23 February 1908 in the Brisbane suburb of New Farm Queensland the eldest son of businessman William Jackson and his wife Edith Educated at Brisbane Grammar School and The Scots College Warwick Jackson joined the Young Australia League with which he visited Europe 1 After leaving school he ran a grazing property in St George 2 By the early 1930s he was in business as a stock and station agent and had interests in engineering and financial concerns He was inspired by the 1934 London to Melbourne Air Race to take up flying and purchased a Klemm Swallow monoplane 1 3 In 1936 he took part in the South Australian centenary air race flying from Brisbane to Adelaide 1 That August he joined the Royal Australian Air Force RAAF Reserve or Citizen Air Force 2 4 In 1937 he upgraded his aircraft to a Beechcraft Staggerwing a type that was faster than many in the RAAF s inventory 3 On 17 February 1938 Jackson married Elisabeth Thompson at Christ Church North Adelaide the couple had a son and a daughter 1 Following the outbreak of World War II Jackson was called up for active duty and commissioned as a pilot officer in the RAAF on 2 October 1939 4 5 His twenty year old brother Arthur also a pilot and keen to join the Air Force was killed in a flying accident later that month 6 7 Two other brothers Edward and Leslie joined the RAAF in November 8 9 10 John Jackson served initially with No 23 Squadron which operated CAC Wirraways at Archerfield Queensland 4 11 He was promoted to flying officer in April 1940 12 That October he was posted to join No 3 Army Cooperation Squadron which had been based in Egypt since August He arrived in the Middle East in November 1940 12 13 Jackson first saw action with No 3 Squadron in the North African campaign at the controls of a Gloster Gladiator Soon after he arrived he had an accident taking off that finished with the biplane on its nose 14 Though he considered himself a full blown operational pilot his experience in air to air gunnery was practically nil and he essentially learned the skills of being a fighter pilot as he went along 3 Once the unit had converted to Hawker Hurricanes he began to score victories in quick succession He shot down three Junkers Ju 87s in a single sortie near Mersa Matruh on 18 February 1941 the same action in which Gordon Steege claimed three 4 15 On 5 April 1941 Jackson fired several bursts at a Ju 87 before his guns jammed he then made two dummy attacks and forced the German plane to crash land in a wadi thus claiming his fourth victory 4 16 After converting to P 40 Tomahawks No 3 Squadron took part in the Syria Lebanon campaign Jackson became an ace on 25 June when he destroyed a Potez 630 light bomber possibly a misidentified LeO 451 of the Vichy French air force He claimed a Dewoitine D 520 fighter on 10 July The next day Jackson shared in the destruction of another D 520 with Bobby Gibbes the pair tossed a coin to take full credit for it Gibbes won to claim his first kill 2 17 Jackson was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 July 1941 12 By now his younger brother Ed had been posted to No 3 Squadron and was serving with him in Palestine 18 19 With the campaign in Syria concluding in mid July the unit undertook no operations in August and personnel went on leave before returning to action in Egypt the next month 20 The rural bred Jackson took to the night life in Alexandria but his stay at a first class hotel left him bewildered as to the purpose of the room s bidet which he eventually determined was some feminine arrangement 3 Peter Ewer in Storm Over Kokoda observed There was something of the patrician about John Jackson but his well to do background had a distinctly Australian tinge to it He liked a game of cards with a bet on the outcome 3 In Whispering Death Mark Johnston noted that although tall and blue eyed he did not have the air of a boy s own or movie star pilot but rather was balding ambling and no extrovert 18 Jackson returned to Australia in November 1941 1 12 Note 1 He was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross DFC for his marked keenness and determination during operations with No 3 Squadron in the Middle East 12 21 The former award was promulgated in the London Gazette on 1 January 1942 and the latter which listed him as John Henry Jackson on 7 April 22 23 The DFC was presented to Jackson s widow Elisabeth after his death 24 Following his return from the Middle East Jackson was briefly an instructor at No 1 Service Flying Training School based at RAAF Station Point Cook Victoria He wrote to his wife I just loathe this joint This training is a tough job and I take my hat off to the boys who have been doing it since war broke out every one of these instructors is longing to be sent overseas but I doubt if they have any chance of ever getting there they are so valuable here 12 25 In January 1942 he was posted to No 4 Squadron which operated Wirraways in Canberra 12 26 As the Japanese advanced towards New Guinea in early 1942 the RAAF urgently established three new fighter units for Australia s northern defence Nos 75 76 and 77 Squadrons 27 Jackson was promoted to acting squadron leader and appointed commanding officer CO of No 75 Squadron on 19 March barely two weeks after the unit was formed at Townsville Queensland 2 28 He took over from Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey who had led No 3 Squadron in the Middle East and been given the task of preparing No 75 for operations at Port Moresby where the local Australian Army garrison was under regular attack by Japanese bombers 27 29 Jeffrey later recalled chiding Jackson for his eagerness to return to combat despite having already done enough in the war to which the latter replied What are you fighting for King and country Well I m fighting for my wife and kids and no Jap bastard s going to get them 30 On 21 March Jackson led the squadron s main force to Seven Mile Aerodrome to take part in the defence of Port Moresby a crucial early battle in the New Guinea campaign 27 and what military aviation historian Andrew Thomas called one of the most gallant episodes in the history of the RAAF 28 The unit was equipped with P 40 Kittyhawks whose long awaited arrival had seen them irreverently dubbed Tomorrowhawks Neverhawks and Mythhawks by the beleaguered garrison at Moresby 29 Jackson s age of thirty four was considered advanced for a fighter pilot and he was affectionately known as Old John to his men one of whom was his younger brother Les now a flight lieutenant As CO Jackson s leadership was to prove inspirational to his pilots many of whom had received only nine days of training in fighter tactics and fired their guns just once 27 29 On 22 March the day after he arrived in New Guinea Jackson took No 75 Squadron on a dawn raid against the Japanese airfield at Lae Rather than attacking directly from the south he led the Kittyhawks in from the east where they would not be expected and where the rising sun would hide their approach Achieving the surprise he had hoped for Jackson made two strafing passes over the airfield ignoring standard practice that called for only one such pass to reduce the risk from anti aircraft fire 29 31 The Australians claimed a dozen Japanese planes destroyed on the ground and five more damaged 2 27 They also shot down two Mitsubishi Zero fighters in the air and lost two Kittyhawks over Lae along with one that had crash landed on takeoff from Moresby 29 31 The Japanese struck back the next day destroying two Kittyhawks at Seven Mile Aerodrome With his losses mounting Jackson was given permission to withdraw the squadron to Horn Island in Far North Queensland but refused 28 29 On 4 April Jackson made a solo reconnaissance over Lae after which he led another four Kittyhawks on a raid against the airfield claiming seven enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground without loss to themselves Japanese sources credited the Australians with only two machines destroyed but seventeen others damaged Two days later Les Jackson was forced to ditch his aircraft on a coral reef but made it to shore with the aid of a life jacket that John dropped to him not realising at the time that the downed pilot was his younger brother 32 33 Jackson himself had to ditch into the sea on 10 April when he was shot down after being surprised by three Zeros during another of his solo reconnaissance missions near Lae 1 28 After playing dead beside his crashed plane to discourage the Japanese fighters from machine gunning him he swam to shore and made his way through jungle for over a week to Wau with the help of two New Guinea natives When he arrived back at Port Moresby in a US Douglas Dauntless on 23 April a Japanese air raid was in progress and a bullet cut off the tip of his right index finger 27 34 Having survived his trek through the jungle he dismissed the wound as a mere scratch 35 On 27 April Jackson met with his pilots and revealed that some senior RAAF officers had expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which No 75 Squadron was avoiding dogfighting with the Japanese Zeros Jackson and his men had generally eschewed such tactics owing to the Zero s superiority to the Kittyhawk in close combat The senior officers comments had evidently stung him as he declared to his pilots Tomorrow I m going to show you how 36 37 According to journalist Osmar White who saw him on the night of the 27th Jackson s hands and eyes were still and rock steady but he appeared weary in soul and too long in the shadows White concluded He had done more than conquer fear he had killed it 38 The next day Jackson led No 75 Squadron s five remaining airworthy Kittyhawks to intercept a force of Japanese bombers and their escort He destroyed an enemy fighter before being shot down and killed 27 28 39 Note 2 His aircraft hit the side of a mountain and embedded itself six feet Jackson was identified only by his size ten boots and the revolver he habitually wore 37 40 His final tally of aerial victories during the war was eight 2 4 12 41 Les Jackson took over command of No 75 Squadron the day after his brother was killed 42 Although the squadron was no longer an effective fighting unit it had checked Japan s attempts to overpower Port Moresby by air attack and the town continued to function as an important Allied base 27 43 John Jackson was survived by his wife and children and interred in Moresby s Bomana War Cemetery 1 44 His estate was sworn for probate at a value of 29 780 1 870 800 in 2011 45 46 His name appears on panel 104 of the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial AWM Canberra 47 Jackson was a keen amateur film maker and a four minute reel of 16 mm footage that he shot in Port Moresby is held by the AWM 48 49 Moresby s Seven Mile Aerodrome was renamed Jackson s Strip in his honour it later became Jacksons International Airport 1 29 In a 1989 interview fellow No 75 Squadron member Flight Lieutenant Albert Tucker commented I would say that had John F Jackson not existed the squadron would not have been effective in that defence role for as long as it was So the whole spirit of John F s leadership and I suppose his final sacrifice was the thing that made 75 Squadron 50 In March 2003 the St George township erected a monument to Jackson and another local RAAF identity Aboriginal fighter pilot Len Waters 51
