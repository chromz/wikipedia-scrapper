Myles Standish c 1584 October 3 1656 was an English military officer hired by the Pilgrims as military adviser for Plymouth Colony He accompanied them on the Mayflower journey and played a leading role in the administration and defense of Plymouth Colony from its inception 2 On February 17 1621 the Plymouth Colony militia elected him as its first commander and continued to re elect him to that position for the remainder of his life 3 He served as an agent of Plymouth Colony in England as assistant governor and as treasurer of the Colony 4 He was also one of the first settlers and founders of the town of Duxbury Massachusetts 5 A defining characteristic of Standish s military leadership was his proclivity for preemptive action which resulted in at least two attacks or small skirmishes against Indians in the Nemasket raid and the conflict at Wessagusset Colony During these actions Standish exhibited courage and skill as a soldier but he also demonstrated a brutality that angered the Indians and disturbed more moderate members of the Colony 6 One of Standish s last military actions on behalf of Plymouth Colony was the botched Penobscot expedition in 1635 By the 1640s he relinquished his role as an active soldier and settled into a quieter life on his Duxbury farm He was still nominally the commander of the Pilgrim military forces in the growing Colony although he seems to have preferred to act in an advisory capacity 7 He died in his home in Duxbury in 1656 at age 72 8 He supported and defended the Pilgrims colony for much of his life though there is no evidence to suggest that he ever joined their church 9 Several towns and military installations have been named for Standish and monuments have been built in his memory One of the best known depictions of him in popular culture was the 1858 poem The Courtship of Miles Standish by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow The highly fictionalized story presents him as a timid romantic 10 It was extremely popular in the 19th century and played a significant role in cementing the Pilgrim story in American culture 11 Little is definitively known of Myles Standish s origin and early life His place of birth has been subject to debate among historians for more than 150 years 12 At the center of the debate is language in his will drafted in Plymouth Colony in 1656 regarding his rights of inheritance Standish wrote I give unto my son heire apparent Alexander Standish all my lands as heire apparent by lawfull decent in Ormskirke Ormskirk Borscouge Burscough Wrightington Maudsley Mawdesley Newburrow Newburgh Crowston Croston and in the Isle of man sic and given to mee as Right heire by lawfull decent but Surruptuously detained from mee My great Grandfather being a 2cond or younger brother from the house of Standish of Standish 12 The places named by Standish are all in Lancashire England with the exception of the Isle of Man leading some to conclude that he was born in Lancashire possibly in the vicinity of Chorley where a branch of the Standish family owned a manor known as Duxbury Hall 13 However efforts have been inconclusive in linking him to the Standishes of Duxbury Hall A competing theory focuses on his mention of the Isle of Man and argues that he belonged to a Manx branch of the Standish family No definitive documentation exists in either location to provide clear evidence of his birthplace 12 Aside from Standish s will the earliest source describing Standish s family and early life is a short passage recorded by Nathaniel Morton secretary of Plymouth Colony who wrote in his New England s Memorial published in 1669 that Standish was a gentleman born in Lancashire and was heir apparent unto a great estate of lands and livings surreptitiously detained from him his great grandfather being a second or younger brother from the house of Standish In his younger time he went over into the low countries and was a soldier there and came acquainted with the church at Leyden and came over into New England with such of them as at the first set out for the planting of the plantation of New Plymouth and bare a deep share of their first difficulties and was always very faithful to their interest 14 The circumstances are vague at best concerning Standish s early military career in Holland the low countries to which Morton referred At the time the Dutch Republic was embroiled in the Eighty Years War with Spain Queen Elizabeth I of England chose to support the Protestant Dutch Republic and sent troops to fight the Spanish in Holland Historians are divided on his role in the English military Nathaniel Philbrick refers to Standish as a mercenary suggesting that he was a hired soldier of fortune seeking opportunity in Holland 15 but Justin Winsor claims that Standish received a lieutenant s commission in the English army and was subsequently promoted to captain in Holland 13 Jeremy Bangs a leading scholar of Pilgrim history noted that Standish likely served under Sir Horatio Vere an English general who had recruited soldiers in both Lancashire and the Isle of Man among other places and who led the English troops in Holland at the time when Standish was there 12 Standish apparently came to Holland around 1603 and according to historian Tudor Jenks may have seen service during the siege of Sluis in 1604 in which Vere s English troops were involved The subsequent Twelve Years Truce 1609 1621 between Spain and the Dutch Republic might have ended Standish s service 16 He was certainly still in Holland in 1620 and living in Leiden when he was hired by a group of refugee Puritan dissenters from England to act as their adviser on military matters 17 At that time he was using the title of Captain When considering candidates for this important position the Puritans had at first hoped to engage Captain John Smith one of the founders of the English colony at Jamestown Virginia who had also explored and mapped the American coast They approached him to return to the New World and he expressed interest His experience made him an attractive candidate but the Pilgrims ultimately decided against him his price was too high and they feared that his fame and bold character might lead him to become a dictator 18 Standish lived in Leiden with his wife Rose and was apparently already known to them 12 On July 22 1620 Old Style date the initial group of English Dissenters living in Leiden boarded the Speedwell which was meant to accompany another ship to be hired in England This initial group included the mostly Brownist congregation Myles and Rose Standish were aboard along with the Bradfords Winslows Carvers and others The small 60 ton pinnace sailed to Southampton with about 30 passengers to be provisioned and join a much larger vessel for the voyage to the New World Another 90 passengers would board the 180 ton Mayflower The Speedwell had some significant leaks while in port that caused delays but both vessels departed Southampton on August 5 19 The leaders of the colony decided to leave the smaller Speedwell behind after numerous delays caused by leaking which had caused them to return to port twice The Standishes and most of the Speedwell passengers crowded into the Mayflower and the Speedwell went on to London to be resold now with only a few passengers 19 She subsequently made numerous successful journeys as a cargo vessel for her new owners but never sailed to the New World The Mayflower passengers meanwhile sold some valuable supplies such as butter to pay the mounting port fees and finally departed Plymouth England on September 6 1620 bound for the northern part of the Virginia Colony The passage of the Mayflower across the Atlantic lasted more than two months with 102 passengers crowded onto the cargo ship s gun deck and about 30 crew members The seas were not severe during the first month of the voyage but by the second month the ship was being hit by strong autumn gales causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage One passenger died at sea and four others died while the ship was anchored at Cape Cod 20 On November 9 1620 lookouts spotted land but they discovered that they were near Cape Cod and about 200 miles east northeast of their planned destination of northern Virginia They tried briefly to sail south but strong seas forced them to retreat to Cape Cod to harbor near the hook of Provincetown Harbor 21 It became apparent that the weather would not permit the passage south so they decided to settle near Cape Cod Shortage of supplies including wood and beer and the roaring Atlantic made it too dangerous to press on for a Virginia landing They anchored at the hook on November 11 19 and the leaders of the colony wrote the Mayflower Compact to ensure a degree of law and order in this place where they had not been granted a patent to settle Myles Standish was one of the 41 men who signed it 22 The Mayflower was anchored off Cape Cod when Standish urged the colony s leaders to allow him to take a party ashore to find a suitable place for settlement 23 On November 15 1620 he led 16 men on foot in exploration of the northern portion of the Cape 24 On December 11 he led a group of 18 and made an extended exploration of the shore of Cape Cod by boat 25 spending their nights ashore surrounded by makeshift barricades of tree branches They were attacked one night by a group of about 30 Indians They panicked but Standish calmed them urging them not to fire their matchlock muskets unnecessarily 26 The incident took place in Eastham Massachusetts and came to be known as the First Encounter After further exploration the Pilgrims chose a location in Plymouth Bay in late December 1620 as the site for their settlement Standish provided important counsel on the placement of a small fort in which cannon were mounted and on the layout of the first houses for maximum defensibility 2 They had built only one single room house when illness struck Only 50 survived the first winter out of the 100 or so who arrived on the Mayflower 27 Standish s wife Rose died in January 28 Standish was one of the very few who did not fall ill and William Bradford credited him with comforting many and being a source of strength to those who suffered 29 Standish tended to Bradford during his illness and this was the beginning of a decades long friendship 30 Bradford held the position of governor for most of his life and by necessity worked closely with Standish The two men were opposites in terms of character Bradford was patient and slow to judgment while Standish was well known for his fiery temper 31 Despite their differences the two worked well together in managing the colony and responding to dangers as they arose 32 By February 1621 the colonists had sighted Indians several times but there had been no communication The men of the colony were anxious to prepare themselves in case of hostilities so they formed a militia on February 17 1621 consisting of all able bodied men electing Standish as their commander The leaders of Plymouth Colony had already hired him for that role but this vote ratified the decision by democratic process 3 The men of Plymouth Colony continued to re elect him to that position for the remainder of his life As captain of the militia he regularly drilled his men in the use of pikes and muskets 33 Contact with the Indians came in March 1621 through Samoset an English speaking Abenaki who arranged for the Pilgrims to meet with Massasoit the sachem of the nearby Pokanoket tribe On March 22 Plymouth Colony s governor John Carver signed a treaty with Massasoit declaring an alliance between the Pokanokets and the Colonists and requiring the two parties to defend one another in times of need 34 Governor Carver died the same year and the responsibility of upholding the treaty fell to his successor William Bradford Bradford and Standish were frequently preoccupied with the complex task of reacting to threats against both the Pilgrims and the Pokanokets from tribes such as the Massachusetts and the Narragansetts 32 As threats arose Standish typically advocated intimidation to deter their rivals Such behavior at times made Bradford uncomfortable but he found it an expedient means of maintaining the treaty with the Pokanokets 35 The first challenge to the treaty came in August 1621 when a sachem named Corbitant began to undermine Massasoit s leadership Corbitant worked to turn the people against Massasoit in the Pokanoket village of Nemasket now the site of Middleborough Massachusetts about 14 miles 23 km west of Plymouth 32 Bradford sent two trusted interpreters to determine what was happening in Nemasket Tisquantum known to the English as Squanto and Hobbamock Tisquantum had been pivotal in providing counsel and aid to the Pilgrims ensuring the survival of the colony Hobbamock was another influential ally a high ranking advisor to Massasoit and a warrior who commanded particular respect and fear among the Indians When Tisquantum and Hobbamock arrived in Nemasket Corbitant took Tisquantum captive and threatened to kill him Hobbamock escaped to warn Plymouth 36 Bradford and Standish agreed that this represented a dangerous threat to the Plymouth Pokanoket alliance and decided to act quickly On August 14 1621 Standish led a group of 10 men to Nemasket determined to kill Corbitant 32 They were guided by Hobbamock who quickly befriended Standish and the two men were close for the remainder of their lives In his old age Hobbamock became part of Standish s household in Duxbury 37 Reaching Nemasket Standish planned a night attack on the shelter in which Corbitant was believed to be sleeping That night he and Hobbamock burst into the shelter shouting for Corbitant As frightened Pokanokets attempted to escape Standish s men outside fired their muskets wounding a Pokanoket man and woman who were later taken to Plymouth to be treated Standish soon learned that Corbitant had already fled the village and Tisquantum was unharmed 38 Standish had failed to capture Corbitant but the raid had the desired effect On September 13 1621 nine sachems came to Plymouth including Corbitant to sign a treaty of loyalty to King James 39 In November 1621 a Narragansett messenger arrived in Plymouth and delivered a bundle of arrows wrapped in a snakeskin Tisquantum and Hobbamock told them that this was a threat and an insult from Narragansett sachem Canonicus 40 The Narragansetts lived west of Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island and were one of the more powerful tribes in the region Bradford sent back the snakeskin filled with gunpowder and shot in an effort to show that they were not intimidated 41 Standish took the threat seriously and urged that the colonists encircle their small village with a palisade made of tall upright logs The proposal would require a wall more than half a mile or 0 8 km long 42 In addition he recommended the construction of strong gates and platforms for shooting over the wall The colony had recently been reinforced by the arrival of new colonists from the ship Fortune but there were still only 50 men to work on the task Despite the challenges the settlers constructed the palisade per Standish s recommendations in just three months finishing in March 1622 Standish divided the militia into four companies one to man each wall and drilled them in defending the village in the event of attack 43 A more serious threat came from the Massachusett tribe to the north and was precipitated by the arrival of a new group of English colonists In April 1622 the vanguard of a new colony arrived in Plymouth They had been sent by merchant Thomas Weston to establish a new settlement somewhere near Plymouth The men chose a site on the shore of the Fore River in Weymouth Massachusetts about 25 miles 40 km north of Plymouth and they called their colony Wessagusset The settlers of the poorly managed colony infuriated the Massachusett tribe through theft and recklessness 44 By March 1623 Massasoit had learned that a group of influential Massachusett warriors intended to destroy both the Wessagusset and Plymouth colonies He warned Plymouth to strike first One of the colonists of Wessagusset named Phineas Pratt verified that his settlement was in danger He managed to escape to Plymouth and reported that the colonists in Wessagusset had been repeatedly threatened by the Massachusetts that the settlement was in a state of constant watchfulness and that men were dying at their posts from starvation 45 Bradford called a public meeting at which the Pilgrims decided to send Standish and a small group of eight including Hobbamock to Wessagusset to kill the leaders of the plot 46 The mission had a personal aspect for Standish One of the warriors threatening Wessagusset was Wituwamat a Neponset who had earlier insulted and threatened Standish 47 Standish arrived at Wessagusset and found that many of the colonists had gone to live with the Massachusetts and he ordered them to be called back to Wessagusset Pecksuot was a Massachusett warrior and leader of the group threatening Wessagusset he came to the settlement with Wituwamat and other warriors the day after Standish s arrival Standish claimed simply to be in Wessagusset on a trading mission but Pecksuot said to Hobbamock Let him begin when he dare he shall not take us unawares 48 Later in the day Pecksuot approached Standish looking down on him and said You are a great captain yet you are but a little man Though I be no sachem yet I am of great strength and courage 49 The next day Standish arranged to meet with Pecksuot over a meal in one of Wessagusset s one room houses Pecksuot brought Wituwamat Wituwamat s adolescent brother and several women Standish had three men of Plymouth and Hobbamock with him in the house On an arranged signal they shut the door of the house and Standish attacked Pecksuot stabbing him repeatedly with the man s own knife 49 Wituwamat and the third warrior were also killed Standish ordered two more Massachusett warriors to be put to death then went outside the walls of Wessagusset in search of Obtakiest a sachem of the Massachusett tribe They soon encountered Obtakiest with a group of warriors and a skirmish ensued during which Obtakiest escaped 50 Having accomplished his mission Standish returned to Plymouth with Wituwamat s head 51 The leaders of the plot to destroy the settlements had been killed and the threat removed but the action had unexpected consequences The settlement of Wessagusset was all but abandoned after the incident which Standish had been trying to protect Most of the settlers departed for an English fishing post on Monhegan Island The attack also caused widespread panic among Indian tribes throughout the region Villages were abandoned and the Pilgrims had difficulty reviving trade for some time 52 Pastor John Robinson was still in Leiden but he criticized Standish for his brutality 53 Bradford too was uncomfortable with his methods but he defended him in a letter As for Capten Standish we leave him to answer for him selfe but this we must say he is as helpfull an instrument as any we have and as carefull of the generall good 54 In 1625 another group of English settlers established an outpost not far from the site of Wessagusset located in Quincy Massachusetts about 27 miles 43 km north of Plymouth The settlement was officially known as Mount Wollaston but soon earned the nickname Merrymount Their leader Thomas Morton encouraged behavior that the Pilgrims found objectionable and dangerous The men of Merrymount built a maypole drank liberally refused to observe the Sabbath and sold weapons to the Indians 55 Bradford found the weapons sales particularly disturbing and ordered Standish to lead an expedition to arrest Morton in 1628 56 Standish arrived with a group of men to find that the small band at Merrymount had barricaded themselves within a small building Morton eventually decided to attack the men from Plymouth but the Merrymount group were too drunk to handle their weapons 56 Morton aimed a weapon at Standish which the captain ripped from his hands Standish and his men took Morton to Plymouth and eventually sent him back to England Later Morton wrote the book New English Canaan in which he referred to Standish as Captain Shrimp and added I have found the Massachusetts Indians more full of humanity than the Christians 57 Standish s last significant expedition was against the French 58 who had established a trading post in 1613 on the Penobscot River in Castine Maine English forces captured the settlement in 1628 and turned it over to Plymouth Colony It was a valuable source of furs and timber for the Pilgrims for seven years However the French mounted a small expedition in 1635 and easily reclaimed the settlement 59 Bradford ordered Standish to take action determined that the post be reclaimed in Plymouth Colony s name This was a significantly larger proposition than the small expeditions which Standish had previously led and to accomplish the task he chartered the ship Good Hope captained by a man named Girling 59 Standish s plan appears to have been to bring the Good Hope within cannon range of the trading post and to bombard the French into surrendering Unfortunately Girling ordered the bombardment before the ship was within range and quickly spent all the gunpowder on board Standish gave up the effort 59 By this time the neighboring and more populous Massachusetts Bay Colony had been established Bradford appealed to leaders of the colony in Boston for help in reclaiming the trading post but the Bay Colony refused The incident was indicative of the rivalry which persisted between Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies 59 In 1691 the two were merged to become the royal Province of Massachusetts Bay In 1625 Plymouth Colony leaders appointed Standish to travel to London to negotiate new terms with the Merchant Adventurers If a settlement could be reached and the Pilgrims could pay off their debt to the Adventurers then the colonists would have new rights to allot land and settle where they pleased Standish was not successful in his negotiations and returned to Plymouth in April 1626 60 Another effort was successful later in 1626 this time negotiated by Isaac Allerton and several leading men of Plymouth including Standish ultimately paid off the colony s debt to the Adventurers 61 The leaders of Plymouth Colony were now free of the directives of the Merchant Adventurers and they exerted their newfound autonomy by organizing a land division in 1627 Large farm lots were parceled out to each family in the colony along the shore of Plymouth Kingston Duxbury and Marshfield Massachusetts Standish received a farm of 120 acres 49 ha in Duxbury 62 and he built a house and settled there around 1628 63 There are indications that Standish began to seek a quieter life by 1635 after the Penobscot expedition maintaining the livestock and fields of his Duxbury farm 64 He was about 51 years old at that time and he began to relinquish the responsibility of defending the colony to a younger generation A note in the colony records of 1635 indicates that Lieutenant William Holmes was appointed to train the militia as Standish s immediate subordinate 65 When the Pequot War loomed in 1637 Standish was appointed to a committee to raise a company of 30 men but it was Holmes who led the company in the field 65 The families living in Duxbury sometimes Duxborough asked to be set off from Plymouth as a separate town with their own church and minister this request was granted in 1637 Historian Justin Winsor and others have insisted that the name of Duxbury was given by Standish in honor of Duxbury Hall near Chorley in Lancashire which was owned by a branch of the Standish family 66 The coincidence would suggest that he had something to do with it though no records exist to indicate how the town was named 67 During the 1640s Standish took on an increasingly administrative role He served as a surveyor of highways as treasurer of the colony from 1644 to 1649 and on various committees to lay out boundaries of new towns and inspect waterways 68 His old friend Hobbamock had been part of his household but he died in 1642 and was buried on Standish s farm in Duxbury 37 Standish died on October 3 1656 of strangullion or strangury a condition often associated with kidney stones or bladder cancer 13 He was buried in Duxbury s Old Burying Ground now known as the Myles Standish Cemetery 69 Myles Standish married Children of Myles and Barbara Standish Standish s true life role in defending Plymouth Colony and the sometimes brutal tactics that he employed were largely obscured by the fictionalized character created by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his narrative poem The Courtship of Miles Standish Historian Tudor Jenks wrote that Longfellow s book had no claim to be considered other than a pleasant little fairystory and as an entirely misleading sketch of men and matters in old Plymouth 75 However the book elevated Standish to the level of folk hero in Victorian America In late 19th century Duxbury the book generated a movement to build monuments in Standish s honor a beneficial by product of which was increased tourism to the town 11 The first of these monuments was the largest 11 The cornerstone was laid for the Myles Standish Monument in Duxbury in 1872 with a crowd of ten thousand people attending the ceremonies 11 It was finished in 1898 the third tallest monument to an individual in the United States It is surpassed only by the first dedicated Washington Monument 178 feet in Baltimore Maryland finished in 1829 and the Washington Monument 555 feet in Washington D C dedicated in 1885 11 The top of the monument is 116 feet 35 m overall and at the top stands a 14 foot 4 3 m statue of Standish 11 A second smaller monument was placed over the alleged site of Standish s grave in 1893 69 Two exhumations of Standish s remains were undertaken in 1889 and 1891 to determine the location of his resting place A third exhumation took place in 1930 to place his remains in a hermetically sealed chamber beneath the gravesite monument 69 His burial site is located in Myles Standish Burial Ground in Duxbury 76 The site of Standish s house reveals only a slight depression in the ground where the cellar hole was but it is now a small park owned and maintained by the town of Duxbury 77 Standish Maine 78 is named for him as well as the neighborhood of Standish Minneapolis At least two forts were named after him an earthen fort on Plymouth s Saquish Neck built during the American Civil War and a larger cement fort built on Lovells Island in Boston Harbor in 1895 Both forts are now abandoned 79 Camp Myles Standish in nearby Taunton was also named for him 80 Myles Standish State Forest is located in the towns of Plymouth and Carver in southeastern Massachusetts approximately 45 miles 70 km south of Boston It is the largest publicly owned recreation area in this part of Massachusetts and is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation DCR 81 Myles Standish Hall is a dormitory at Boston University originally constructed as the Myles Standish Hotel in 1925 82 In 2020 Chorley commemorates 400 years of Myles Standish s Pilgrim journey however many elements of its planned year are postponed due to the Covid 19 outbrake 83
