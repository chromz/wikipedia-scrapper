Ulysses S Grant born Hiram Ulysses Grant April 27 1822 July 23 1885 was an American soldier and politician who served as the 18th president of the United States from 1869 to 1877 Before his presidency Grant led the Union Army as Commanding General of the United States Army in winning the American Civil War As president Grant worked with the Radical Republicans in the Reconstruction of the Union while having to deal with corruption in his administration Raised in Ohio young Grant possessed an exceptional ability with horses which served him well through his military career He was admitted to West Point and graduated from the U S military academy in 1843 Grant served with distinction in the Mexican American War In 1848 he married Julia Dent and together they had four children Grant abruptly resigned his army commission in 1854 and returned to his family but lived in poverty for seven years During the Civil War he joined the Union Army in 1861 and led the Vicksburg campaign which gained control of the Mississippi River in 1863 After Grant s victory at Chattanooga President Abraham Lincoln promoted Grant to Lieutenant General For thirteen months Grant fought Robert E Lee during the high casualty Overland Campaign and at Petersburg On April 9 1865 Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox A week later Lincoln was assassinated and was succeeded by President Andrew Johnson who promoted Grant to General of the Army in 1866 Later Grant openly broke with Johnson over Reconstruction policies Grant used the Reconstruction Acts which had been passed over Johnson s veto to enforce civil rights for African freedmen A war hero but a reluctant politician Grant was unanimously nominated by the Republican Party and was elected president in 1868 As president Grant stabilized the post war national economy created the Department of Justice and prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan He appointed African Americans and Jewish Americans to prominent federal offices In 1871 he created the first Civil Service Commission The Liberal Republicans and Democrats united behind Grant s opponent in the presidential election of 1872 but Grant was handily re elected Grant s Native American policy had both successes and failures In foreign affairs the Grant administration peacefully resolved the Alabama claims against Great Britain but the Senate rejected Grant s prized Caribbean Dominican Republic annexation Corruption in the executive branch became notorious several of Grant s cabinet members and other appointees were fired or had to resign The Panic of 1873 plunged the nation into a severe economic depression that allowed the Democrats to win the House majority In the intensely disputed Presidential election of 1876 Grant facilitated the approval by Congress of a peaceful compromise In his retirement Grant was the first president to circumnavigate the world on his tour meeting with many foreign leaders In 1880 Grant was unsuccessful in obtaining the Republican presidential nomination for a third term In the final year of his life facing severe financial reversals and dying of throat cancer he wrote his memoirs which proved to be a major critical and financial success At the time of his death he was memorialized as a symbol of national unity Historians have recognized Grant s military genius and his modern strategies of warfare are featured in military history textbooks Historical assessments of Grant s presidency have improved over time Grant was ranked 38th in 1994 and 1996 but ranked 21st in 2018 Historians have emphasized Grant s presidential accomplishments including the Alabama Claims settlement protection of Blacks and Indians and the first Civil Service Commission Hiram Ulysses Grant was born in Point Pleasant Ohio on April 27 1822 to Jesse Root Grant a tanner and merchant and Hannah Simpson Grant 1 His ancestors Matthew and Priscilla Grant arrived aboard the ship Mary and John at Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630 2 Grant s great grandfather fought in the French and Indian War and his grandfather Noah served in the American Revolution at Bunker Hill 3 Afterward Noah settled in Pennsylvania and married Rachel Kelley the daughter of an Irish pioneer 4 Their son Jesse Ulysses s father was a Whig Party supporter and a fervent abolitionist 5 Jesse Grant moved to Point Pleasant in 1820 and found work as a foreman in a tannery 6 He soon met his future wife Hannah and the two were married on June 24 1821 7 Hannah descended from Presbyterian immigrants from Ballygawley in County Tyrone Ireland 8 9 Ten months after she was married Hannah gave birth to Ulysses her and Jesse s first child 10 The boy s name Ulysses was drawn from ballots placed in a hat To honor his father in law Jesse declared the boy named Hiram Ulysses though he would always refer to him as Ulysses 11 b In 1823 the family moved to Georgetown Ohio where five more siblings were born Simpson Clara Orvil Jennie and Mary 13 At the age of five Ulysses began his formal education starting at a subscription school and later in two private schools 14 In the winter of 1836 1837 Grant was a student at Maysville Seminary and in the autumn of 1838 he attended John Rankin s academy In his youth Grant developed an unusual ability to ride and manage horses 15 Grant disliked the tannery so his father put his ability with horses to use by giving him work driving wagon loads of supplies and transporting people 16 Unlike his siblings Grant was not forced to attend church by his Methodist parents 17 c For the rest of his life he prayed privately and never officially joined any denomination 19 To others including his own son Grant appeared to be an agnostic 20 He inherited some of Hannah s Methodist piety and quiet nature 21 Grant was largely apolitical before the war but wrote If I had ever had any political sympathies they would have been with the Whigs I was raised in that school 22 Grant s father wrote to Representative Thomas L Hamer requesting that he nominate Ulysses to the United States Military Academy USMA at West Point New York Despite political differences with Jesse Root Grant Hamer a Democrat nominated his 17 year old son to West Point in Spring 1839 23 Grant was accepted on July 1 although he doubted his academic abilities 24 Hamer unfamiliar with Grant submitted an incorrect name to West Point On September 14 Grant was enlisted Cadet U S Grant at the national academy 25 d His nickname at West Point became Sam among army colleagues since the initials U S also stood for Uncle Sam 29 e Initially Grant was indifferent to military life but within a year he reexamined his desire to leave the academy and later wrote that on the whole I like this place very much 31 While at the Academy his greatest interest was horses and he earned a reputation as the most proficient horseman 32 During the graduation ceremony while riding York a large and powerful horse that only Grant could manage he set a high jump record that stood for 25 years 33 f Seeking relief from military routine he studied under Romantic artist Robert Walter Weir producing nine surviving artworks 35 He spent more time reading books from the library than his academic texts including works by James Fenimore Cooper and others 36 On Sundays cadets were required to march to and attend services at the academy s church a requirement that Grant disliked 37 Quiet by nature Grant established a few intimate friends among fellow cadets including Frederick Tracy Dent and James Longstreet He was inspired both by the Commandant Captain Charles F Smith and by General Winfield Scott who visited the academy to review the cadets Grant later wrote of the military life there is much to dislike but more to like 38 Grant graduated on June 30 1843 ranked 21st out of 39 in his class and was promoted the next day to the rank brevet second lieutenant 39 Small for his age at 17 he had entered the academy weighing only 117 pounds at five feet two inches tall upon graduation four years later he had grown to a height of five feet seven inches 40 Grant planned to resign his commission after his four year term of duty He would later write to a friend that among the happiest days of his life were the day he left the presidency and the day he left the academy 41 Despite his excellent horsemanship he was not assigned to the cavalry but to the 4th Infantry Regiment Grant s first assignment took him to the Jefferson Barracks near St Louis Missouri Lt Col Robert C Buchanan fined Grant wine bottles for Grant s late returns from White Haven 42 Commanded by Colonel Stephen W Kearny the barracks was the nation s largest military base in the west 43 Grant was happy with his new commander but looked forward to the end of his military service and a possible teaching career 44 In Missouri Grant visited Dent s family and became engaged to his sister Julia in 1844 44 Four years later on August 22 1848 they were married at Julia s home in St Louis Grant s abolitionist father disapproved of the Dents owning slaves and neither of Grant s parents attended the wedding 45 Grant was flanked by three fellow West Point graduates all dressed in their blue uniforms including Longstreet Julia s cousin 46 g At the end of the month Julia was warmly received by Grant s family in Bethel Ohio 49 They had four children Frederick Ulysses Jr Buck Ellen Nellie and Jesse 50 After the wedding Grant obtained a two month extension to his leave and returned to St Louis when he decided with a wife to support that he would remain in the army 51 After rising tensions with Mexico following the United States annexation of Texas war broke out in 1846 During the conflict Grant distinguished himself as a daring and competent soldier 52 Before the war President John Tyler had ordered Grant s unit to Louisiana as part of the Army of Observation under Major General Zachary Taylor 53 In September 1846 Tyler s successor James K Polk unable to provoke Mexico into war at Corpus Christi Texas ordered Taylor to march 150 miles south to the Rio Grande Marching south to Fort Texas to prevent a Mexican siege Grant experienced combat for the first time on May 8 1846 at the Battle of Palo Alto 54 Grant served as regimental quartermaster but yearned for a combat role when finally allowed he led a charge at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma 55 He demonstrated his equestrian ability at the Battle of Monterrey by volunteering to carry a dispatch past snipers where he hung off the side of his horse keeping the animal between him and the enemy Before leaving the city he assured some wounded Americans he would send for help 56 Polk wary of Taylor s growing popularity divided his forces sending some troops including Grant s unit to form a new army under Major General Winfield Scott 57 Traveling by sea Scott s army landed at Veracruz and advanced toward Mexico City 58 The army met the Mexican forces at the battles of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec outside Mexico City 59 For his bravery at Molino del Rey Grant was brevetted first lieutenant on September 30 60 At San Cosmé Grant directed his men to drag a disassembled howitzer into a church steeple then reassembled it and bombarded nearby Mexican troops 59 His bravery and initiative earned him his brevet promotion to captain 61 On September 14 1847 Scott s army marched into the city Mexico ceded the vast territory including California to the U S on February 2 1848 62 During the war Grant established a commendable record studied the tactics and strategies of Scott and Taylor and emerged as a seasoned officer writing in his memoirs that this is how he learned much about military leadership 63 In retrospect although he respected Scott he identified his leadership style with Taylor s However Grant also wrote that the Mexican war was morally unjust and that the territorial gains were designed to expand slavery stating I was bitterly opposed to the measure and to this day regard the war which resulted as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation He opined that the Civil War was divine punishment on the U S for its aggression against Mexico 64 During the war Grant discovered his moral courage and began to consider a career in the army 65 Grant s first post war assignments took him and Julia to Detroit on November 17 1848 but he was soon transferred to Madison Barracks a desolate outpost in upstate New York in bad need of supplies and repair After four months Grant was sent back to his quartermaster job in Detroit 66 When the discovery of gold in California brought droves of prospectors and settlers to the territory Grant and the 4th infantry were ordered to reinforce the small garrison there Grant was charged with bringing the soldiers and a few hundred civilians from New York City to Panama overland to the Pacific and then north to California Julia eight months pregnant with Ulysses Jr did not accompany him While Grant was in Panama a cholera epidemic broke out and claimed the lives of many soldiers civilians and children Grant established and organized a field hospital in Panama City and moved the worst cases to a hospital barge one mile offshore 67 When orderlies protested having to attend to the sick Grant did much of the nursing himself earning high praise from observers 68 In August Grant arrived in San Francisco His next assignment sent him north to Vancouver Barracks in the Oregon Territory 69 Grant tried several business ventures but failed and in one instance his business partner absconded with 800 of Grant s investment 70 Concerning local Indians Grant assured Julia by letter they were harmless and he developed empathy for their plight 71 Grant witnessed white agents cheating Indians of their supplies and the devastation of smallpox and measles transferred by white settlers 72 Promoted to captain on August 5 1853 Grant was assigned to command Company F 4th Infantry at the newly constructed Fort Humboldt in California 73 Grant arrived at Fort Humboldt on January 5 1854 commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert C Buchanan a martinet officer with whom Grant had earlier crossed paths at Jefferson Barracks 74 Separated from his wife and family Grant began to drink 75 Colonel Buchanan reprimanded Grant for one drinking episode and told Grant to resign or reform Grant told Buchanan he would resign if I don t reform 76 On Sunday Grant was found influenced by alcohol but not incapacitated at his company s pay table 77 Keeping his pledge to Buchanan Grant resigned effective July 31 1854 78 Buchanan endorsed Grant s letter of resignation but did not submit any report that verified the incident 79 h Grant did not face court martial and the War Department said Nothing stands against his good name 85 Grant said years later the vice of intemperance drunkenness had not a little to do with my decision to resign 86 With no means of support Grant returned to St Louis and reunited with his family uncertain about his future 87 At age 32 with no civilian vocation Grant needed work to support his growing family It was the beginning of seven years of financial struggles poverty and instability 88 Grant s father offered him a place in the Galena Illinois branch of the family s leather business but demanded Julia and the children stay in Missouri with the Dents or with the Grants in Kentucky Grant and Julia declined the offer In 1855 Grant farmed using Julia s slave Dan on his brother in law s property Wish ton wish near St Louis 89 The farm was not successful and to earn a living he sold firewood on St Louis street corners 90 The next year the Grants moved to land on Julia s father s farm and built a home called Hardscrabble on Grant s Farm Julia described the rustic house as an unattractive cabin but made the dwelling as homelike as possible with the family s keepsakes and other belongings 91 Grant s family lacked money clothes and furniture but always had enough food 92 During the Panic of 1857 which devastated many farmers including Grant who pawned his gold watch to pay for Christmas gifts for his family 93 In 1858 Grant rented out Hardscrabble and moved his family to Julia s father s 850 acre plantation 94 That fall after suffering from malaria Grant gave up farming 95 The same year Grant acquired a slave from his father in law a thirty five year old man named William Jones 96 Although Grant was not an abolitionist he was not considered a slavery man and could not bring himself to force a slave to do work 97 In March 1859 Grant freed William by a manumission deed potentially worth at least 1 000 when Grant needed the money 98 Grant moved to St Louis taking on a partnership with Julia s cousin Harry Boggs working in the real estate business as a bill collector again without success and with Julia s prompting ended the partnership 99 In August Grant applied for a position as county engineer believing his education qualified him for the job He had thirty five notable recommendations but the position was given on the basis of political affiliation and Grant was passed over by the Free Soil and Republican county commissioners because he was believed to share his father in law s Democratic sentiments 100 In the 1856 presidential election Grant cast his first presidential vote for Democrat James Buchanan later saying he was really voting against Republican John C Frémont over concern that his anti slavery position would lead to southern secession and war and because he considered Frémont to be a shameless self promoter 101 In April 1860 Grant and his family moved north to Galena accepting a position in his father s leather goods business run by his younger brothers Simpson and Orvil 102 i In a few months Grant paid off his debts 104 The family attended the local Methodist church and he soon established himself as a reputable citizen of Galena 105 For the 1860 election he could not vote because he was not yet a legal resident of Illinois but he favored Democrat Stephen A Douglas over the eventual winner Abraham Lincoln and Lincoln over the Southern Democrat John C Breckinridge 106 He was torn between his increasingly anti slavery views and the fact that his wife remained a staunch Democrat 107 On April 12 1861 the American Civil War began when Confederate troops attacked Fort Sumter in Charleston South Carolina 108 The news came as a shock in Galena and Grant shared his neighbors concern about the war 109 On April 15 Lincoln called for 75 000 volunteers 110 The next day Grant attended a mass meeting to assess the crisis and encourage recruitment and a speech by his father s attorney John Aaron Rawlins stirred Grant s patriotism 111 j Ready to fight Grant recalled with satisfaction I never went into our leather store again 112 k On April 18 Grant chaired a second recruitment meeting but turned down a captain s position as commander of the newly formed militia company hoping his previous experience would aid him to obtain more senior military rank 114 Grant s early efforts to be recommissioned were rejected by Major General George B McClellan and Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon On April 29 supported by Congressman Elihu B Washburne of Illinois Grant was appointed military aide to Governor Richard Yates and mustered ten regiments into the Illinois militia On June 14 again aided by Washburne Grant was promoted to Colonel and put in charge of the unruly 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment which he soon restored to good order and discipline 115 Colonel Grant and his 21st Regiment were transferred to Missouri to dislodge Confederate forces 116 On August 5 with Washburne s aid Grant was appointed Brigadier General of volunteers 117 Major General John C Frémont Union commander of the West passed over senior generals and appointed Grant commander of the District of Southeastern Missouri 118 l On September 2 Grant arrived at Cairo Illinois assumed command by replacing Colonel Oglesby and set up his headquarters to plan a campaign down the Mississippi and up the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers 120 After the Confederates moved into western Kentucky with designs on southern Illinois Grant after notifying Frémont and without waiting further for his reply advanced on Paducah Kentucky taking it without a fight on September 6 121 Having understood the importance to Lincoln about Kentucky s neutrality Grant assured its citizens I have come among you not as your enemy but as your friend 122 On November 1 Frémont ordered Grant to make demonstrations against the Confederates on both sides of the Mississippi but prohibited him from attacking the enemy 123 On November 2 1861 Lincoln removed Frémont from command freeing Grant to attack Confederate soldiers encamped in Cape Girardeau Missouri 123 On November 5 Grant along with Brigadier General John A McClernand landed 2 500 men at Hunter s Point and on November 7 engaged the Confederates at the Battle of Belmont 124 The Union army took the camp but the reinforced Confederates under Brigadier Generals Frank Cheatham and Gideon J Pillow forced a chaotic Union retreat 125 Grant had wanted to destroy Confederate strongholds at both Belmont Missouri and Columbus Kentucky but was not given enough troops and was only able to disrupt their positions Grant s troops fought their way back to their Union boats and escaped back to Cairo under fire from the fortified stronghold at Columbus 126 Although Grant and his army retreated the battle gave his volunteers much needed confidence and experience 127 It also showed Lincoln that Grant was a general willing to fight 128 Columbus blocked Union access to the lower Mississippi Grant and General James B McPherson planned to bypass Columbus and with a force of 25 000 troops move against Fort Henry on the Tennessee River They would then march ten miles east to Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River with the aid of gunboats opening both rivers and allowing the Union access further south Grant presented his plan to Henry Halleck his new commander in the newly created Department of Missouri 129 Halleck was considering the same strategy but rebuffed Grant believing he needed twice the number of troops However after Halleck telegraphed and consulted McClellan about the plan he finally agreed on condition that the attack be conducted in close cooperation with navy Flag Officer Andrew H Foote 130 Foote s gunboats bombarded Fort Henry leading to its surrender on February 6 1862 before Grant s infantry even arrived 131 Grant then ordered an immediate assault on Fort Donelson which dominated the Cumberland River Unlike Fort Henry Grant was now opposed by a force equal to his own Unaware of the garrison s strength Grant s forces were over confident Grant McClernand and Smith positioned their divisions around the fort The next day McClernand and Smith launched probing attacks on apparent weak spots in the Confederate line only to retreat with heavy losses On February 14 Foote s gunboats began bombarding the fort only to be repulsed by its heavy guns Thus far the Confederates were winning but soon Union reinforcements arrived giving Grant a total force of over 40 000 men When Foote regained control of the river Grant resumed his attack resulting in a standoff Grant received a dispatch from Foote requesting that they meet Grant mounted a horse and rode seven miles over freezing roads and trenches reaching Smith s division instructing him to prepare for the next assault and rode on and met up with McClernand and Wallace After exchanging reports he met up with Foote On February 16 Foote resumed his bombardment which signaled a general attack Confederate generals John B Floyd and Pillow fled leaving the fort in command of Simon Bolivar Buckner who submitted to Grant s demand for unconditional and immediate surrender 132 Grant had won the first major victory for the Union capturing Floyd s entire rebel army of more than 12 000 Halleck was angry that Grant had acted without his authorization and complained to McClellan accusing Grant of neglect and inefficiency On March 3 Halleck sent a telegram to Washington complaining that he had no communication with Grant for a week Three days later Halleck followed up with a postscript claiming word has just reached me that Grant has resumed his bad habits of drinking 133 Lincoln regardless promoted Grant to major general of volunteers and the Northern press treated Grant as a hero Playing off his initials they took to calling him Unconditional Surrender Grant 134 With great armies now massing it was widely thought in the North that another western battle might end the war 135 Grant reinstated by Halleck at the urging of Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton left Fort Henry and traveled by boat up the Tennessee River to rejoin his army with orders to advance with the Army of the Tennessee into Tennessee Grant s main army was located at Pittsburg Landing while 40 000 Confederate troops converged at Corinth Mississippi 136 Brigadier General William Tecumseh Sherman assured Grant that his green troops were ready for an attack Grant agreed and wired Halleck with their assessment 137 Grant wanted to attack the Confederates at Corinth but Halleck ordered him not to attack until Major General Don Carlos Buell arrived with his division of 25 000 138 Meanwhile Grant prepared for an attack on the Confederate army of roughly equal strength Instead of preparing defensive fortifications between the Tennessee River and Owl Creek m and clearing fields of fire they spent most of their time drilling the largely inexperienced troops while Sherman dismissed reports of nearby Confederates 139 Union inaction created the opportunity for the Confederates to attack first before Buell arrived 140 On the morning of April 6 1862 Grant s troops were taken by surprise when the Confederates led by Generals Albert Sidney Johnston and P G T Beauregard struck first like an Alpine avalanche near Shiloh church attacking five divisions of Grant s army and forcing a confused retreat toward the Tennessee River 141 Johnston was killed and command fell upon Beauregard 142 One Union line held the Confederate attack off for several hours at a place later called the Hornet s Nest giving Grant time to assemble artillery and 20 000 troops near Pittsburg Landing 143 The Confederates finally broke through the Hornet s Nest to capture a Union division but Grant s Last Line held the landing while the exhausted Confederates lacking reinforcements halted their advance 144 The day s fighting had been costly with thousands of casualties That evening heavy rain set in Sherman found Grant standing alone under a tree in the rain Well Grant we ve had the devil s own day of it haven t we Sherman said Yes replied Grant Lick em tomorrow though 145 Bolstered by 18 000 fresh troops from the divisions of Major Generals Buell and Lew Wallace Grant counterattacked at dawn the next day and regained the field forcing the disorganized and demoralized rebels to retreat back to Corinth 146 Halleck ordered Grant not to advance more than one day s march from Pittsburg Landing stopping the pursuit of the Confederate Army 147 Although Grant had won the battle the situation was little changed with the Union in possession of Pittsburg Landing and the Confederates once again holed up in Corinth 148 Grant now realizing that the South was determined to fight and that the war would not be won with one battle would later write Then indeed I gave up all idea of saving the Union except by complete conquest 149 Shiloh was the costliest battle in American history to that point and the staggering 23 746 total casualties stunned the nation 150 Briefly hailed a hero for routing the Confederates Grant was soon mired in controversy 151 The Northern press castigated Grant for shockingly high casualties and accused him of drunkenness during the battle contrary to the accounts of officers and others with him at the time 152 n Discouraged Grant considered resigning but Sherman convinced him to stay 153 Lincoln dismissed Grant s critics saying I can t spare this man he fights 154 However Grant s victory at Shiloh ended any chance for the Confederates to prevail in the Mississippi valley or regain its strategic advantage in the West 155 Halleck arrived from St Louis on April 11 took command and assembled a combined army of about 120 000 men On April 29 he relieved Grant of field command and replaced him with Major General George Henry Thomas Halleck slowly marched his army to take Corinth entrenching each night 156 Meanwhile Beauregard pretended to be reinforcing sent deserters to the Union Army with that story and moved his army out during the night to Halleck s surprise when he finally arrived at Corinth on May 30 157 Halleck divided his combined army and reinstated Grant as field commander of the Army of the Tennessee on July 11 158 Later that year on September 19 Grant s army defeated Confederates at the Battle of Iuka then successfully defended Corinth inflicting heavy casualties 159 On October 25 Grant assumed command of the District of the Tennessee 160 In November after Lincoln s preliminary Emancipation Proclamation Grant ordered units under his command to incorporate former slaves into the Union Army giving them clothes shelter and wages for their services 161 Grant held western Tennessee with almost 40 000 men 162 The Union capture of Vicksburg the last Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi was vital and would split the Confederacy in two 163 Lincoln however appointed McClernand for the job rather than Grant or Sherman 164 Halleck who retained power over troop displacement ordered McClernand to Memphis and placed him and his troops under Grant s authority 165 On November 13 1862 Grant captured Holly Springs and advanced to Corinth 166 Grant s plan was to march south to Jackson and attack Vicksburg overland while Sherman would attack Vicksburg from Chickasaw Bayou 167 However Confederate cavalry raids on December 11 and 20 1862 broke Union communications and recaptured Holly Springs preventing Grant and Sherman from converging on Vicksburg 168 Grant observed sabotage by civilians who had feigned loyalty and complained Guerrillas are hovering around in every direction 169 On December 29 a Confederate army led by Lieutenant General John C Pemberton repulsed Sherman s direct approach ascending the bluffs to Vicksburg at Chickasaw Bayou 170 McClernand reached Sherman s army assumed command and independently of Grant led a campaign that captured Confederate Fort Hindman 171 Contraband fugitive African American slaves poured into Grant s district whom he sent north to Cairo to be integrated into white society as domestic servants in Chicago However Lincoln ended this move when Illinois political leaders complained 172 On his own initiative Grant set up a pragmatic program and hired a young Presbyterian Chaplain John Eaton to administer slave refuge work camps 173 Compensated contraband freed slaves would be used to pick cotton that would be shipped north and sent to aid the Union War effort Lincoln approved and Grant s camp program was successful 174 Grant also worked freed black labor on the bypass canal and other points on the river incorporating them into the Union Army and Navy 175 Grant s war responsibilities included combating an illegal Northern cotton trade and civilian obstruction 176 177 Smuggling of cotton was rampant while the price of cotton skyrocketed 178 Grant believed the smuggling funded the Confederacy and provided them with military intelligence while Union soldiers were dying in the fields 179 He had received numerous dispatches with complaints about Jewish speculators in his district 180 He also feared the trading corrupted many of his officers who were also eager to make a profit on a bale of cotton while the majority of those involved in illegal trading were not Jewish 181 Outraged that gold paid for southern cotton Grant required two permits one from the Treasury and one from the Union Army to purchase cotton 178 o On December 17 1862 Grant issued a controversial General Order No 11 expelling Jews as a class from his Union Army military district 182 177 p The order was fully enforced at Holly Springs December 17 and Pudacah December 28 Confederate General Van Dorn s raid on Holly Springs December 20 prevented many Jewish people from potential expulsion After complaints Lincoln rescinded the order on January 3 1863 Grant finally stopped the order within three weeks on January 17 184 q On January 29 1863 Grant assumed overall command Eventually he attempted to advance his army through water logged terrain to bypass Vicksburg s guns 190 The plan of attacking Vicksburg from downriver carried great risk because upon crossing the Mississippi river his army would be beyond reach of most of its supply lines 191 On April 16 Grant ordered Admiral David Dixon Porter s gunboats south under fire from the Vicksburg batteries to meet up with troops who had marched south down the west side of the river 192 Grant ordered diversionary battles confusing Pemberton and allowing Grant s army to move east across the Mississippi landing troops at Bruinsburg 193 Grant s army captured Jackson the state capital Advancing west Grant defeated Pemberton s army at the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16 forcing their retreat into Vicksburg 194 After Grant s men assaulted the entrenchments twice suffering severe losses they settled in for a siege lasting seven weeks During quiet periods of the campaign Grant would take to drinking on occasion 195 The personal rivalry between McClernand and Grant continued until Grant removed him from command when he contravened Grant by publishing an order without permission 196 Pemberton surrendered Vicksburg to Grant on July 4 1863 197 Vicksburg s fall gave Union forces control of the Mississippi River and split the Confederacy By that time Grant s political sympathies fully coincided with the Radical Republicans aggressive prosecution of the war and emancipation of the slaves 198 The success at Vicksburg was a morale boost for the Union war effort 196 When Stanton suggested Grant be brought back east to run the Army of the Potomac Grant demurred writing that he knew the geography and resources of the West better and he did not want to upset the chain of command in the East 199 Lincoln promoted Grant to major general and assigned him command of the newly formed Division of the Mississippi on October 16 1863 including command of the Armies of the Ohio Tennessee and Cumberland 200 After the Battle of Chickamauga the Army of the Cumberland retreated into Chattanooga where they became trapped 201 Grant arrived in Chattanooga on horseback assisted by Major General Joseph Hooker with plans to resupply the city and break the siege Union forces captured Brown s Ferry and opened a supply line to Bridgeport 202 On November 23 Grant organized three armies to attack at Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain Two days later Hooker s forces took Lookout Mountain 203 Grant ordered Major General George Henry Thomas to advance when Sherman s army failed to take Missionary Ridge from the northeast 204 The Army of the Cumberland led by Major General Philip Sheridan and Brigadier General Thomas J Wood charged uphill and captured the Confederate entrenchments at the top forcing a retreat 205 The decisive battle gave the Union control of Tennessee and opened Georgia the Confederate heartland to Union invasion 206 Grant was given an enormous thoroughbred horse Cincinnati by a thankful admirer in St Louis 207 On March 2 1864 Lincoln promoted Grant to lieutenant general giving him command of all Union Armies 208 Grant s new rank had only previously been held by George Washington 209 Grant arrived in Washington on March 8 and he was formally commissioned by Lincoln the next day at a Cabinet meeting 210 Grant developed a good working relationship with Lincoln who allowed Grant to devise his own strategy 211 Grant established his headquarters with General George Meade s Army of the Potomac in Culpeper north west of Richmond and met weekly with Lincoln and Stanton in Washington 212 r After protest from Halleck Grant scrapped a risky invasion plan of North Carolina and adopted a plan of five coordinated Union offensives on five fronts so Confederate armies could not shift troops along interior lines 214 Grant and Meade would make a direct frontal attack on Robert E Lee s Army of Northern Virginia while Sherman now chief of the western armies was to destroy Joseph E Johnston s Army of Tennessee and take Atlanta 215 Major General Benjamin Butler would advance on Lee from the southeast up the James River while Major General Nathaniel Banks would capture Mobile 216 Major General Franz Sigel was to capture granaries and rail lines in the fertile Shenandoah Valley 217 Grant now commanded in total 533 000 battle ready troops spread out over an eighteen mile front while the Confederates had lost many officers in battle and had great difficulty finding replacements 218 He was popular and there was talk that a Union victory early in the year could lead to his candidacy for the presidency Grant was aware of the rumors but had ruled out a political candidacy the possibility would soon vanish with delays on the battlefield 219 The Overland Campaign was a series of brutal battles fought in Virginia for seven weeks during May and June 1864 220 Sigel s and Butler s efforts failed and Grant was left alone to fight Lee 221 On the morning of Wednesday May 4 Grant dressed in full uniform sword at his side led the army out from his headquarters at Culpeper towards Germanna Ford 222 They crossed the Rapidan unopposed while supplies were transported on four pontoon bridges 223 On May 5 the Union army attacked Lee in the Wilderness a three day battle with estimated casualties of 17 666 Union and 11 125 Confederate 224 Rather than retreat Grant flanked Lee s army to the southeast and attempted to wedge his forces between Lee and Richmond at Spotsylvania Court House 225 Lee s army got to Spotsylvania first and a costly battle ensued lasting thirteen days with heavy casualties 226 On May 12 Grant attempted to break through Lee s Muleshoe salient guarded by Confederate artillery resulting in one of the bloodiest assaults of the Civil War known as the Bloody Angle 227 Unable to break Lee s lines Grant again flanked the rebels to the southeast meeting at North Anna where a battle lasted three days 228 Grant maneuvered his army to Cold Harbor a vital road hub that linked to Richmond but Lee s men were already entrenched there On the third day of the thirteen day battle Grant led a costly assault and was soon castigated as the Butcher by the Northern press after taking 52 788 Union casualties Lee s Confederate army suffered 32 907 casualties but he was less able to replace them 229 This battle was the second of two that Grant later said he regretted the other being his initial assault on Vicksburg Undetected by Lee Grant moved his army south of the James River freed Butler from the Bermuda Hundred and advanced toward Petersburg Virginia s central railroad hub 230 Beauregard defended Petersburg and Lee s veteran reinforcements soon arrived resulting in a nine month siege Northern resentment grew Sheridan was assigned command of the Union Army of the Shenandoah and Grant directed him to follow the enemy to their death in the Shenandoah Valley When Sheridan suffered attacks by John S Mosby s irregular Confederate cavalry Grant recommended rounding up their families for imprisonment at Fort McHenry 231 After Grant s abortive attempt to capture Petersburg Lincoln supported Grant in his decision to continue and visited Grant s headquarters at City Point on June 21 to assess the state of the army and meet with Grant and Admiral Porter By the time Lincoln departed his appreciation for Grant had grown 232 At Petersburg Grant approved a plan to blow up part of the enemy trenches from a tunnel The explosion created a crater into which poorly led Union troops poured Recovering from the surprise Confederates surrounded the crater and easily picked off Union troops within it The Union s 3 500 casualties outnumbered the Confederates by three to one although the plan could have been successful if implemented correctly Grant admitted the tactic had been a stupendous failure 233 Rather than fight Lee in a full frontal attack as he had done at Cold Harbor Grant continued to extend Lee s defenses south and west of Petersburg to capture essential railroad links 234 Union forces soon captured Mobile Bay and Atlanta and now controlled the Shenandoah Valley ensuring Lincoln s reelection in November 235 Sherman convinced Grant and Lincoln to send his army to march on Savannah 236 Sherman cut a 60 mile path of destruction unopposed reached the Atlantic Ocean and captured Savannah on December 22 237 On December 16 after much prodding by Grant the Union Army under Thomas smashed John Bell Hood s Confederate Army at Nashville 238 These campaigns left Lee s forces at Petersburg as the only significant obstacle remaining to Union victory 239 By March 1865 Grant had severely weakened Lee s strength having extended his lines to 35 miles 240 Lee s troops deserted by the thousands due to hunger and the strains of trench warfare 241 Grant Sherman Porter and Lincoln held a conference to discuss the surrender of Confederate armies and Reconstruction of the South on March 28 242 On April 2 Grant ordered a general assault on Lee s entrenched forces Union troops took Petersburg and captured Richmond the next day 243 Lee and part of his army broke free and attempted to link up with the remnants of Joseph E Johnston s defeated army but Sheridan s cavalry stopped the two armies from converging cutting them off from their supply trains 244 Grant was in communication with Lee before he entrusted his aide Orville Babcock to carry his last dispatch to Lee requesting his surrender with instructions to escort him to a meeting place of Lee s choosing 245 Grant immediately rode west bypassing Lee s army to join Sheridan who had captured Appomattox Station blocking Lee s escape route On his way Grant received a letter sent by Lee informing him that he was ready to surrender 246 On April 9 Grant and Lee met at Appomattox Court House 247 Upon receiving Lee s dispatch about the proposed meeting Grant had been jubilant Although Grant felt depressed at the fall of a foe who had fought so long and valiantly he believed the Southern cause was one of the worst for which a people ever fought 248 After briefly discussing their days of old in Mexico Grant wrote out the terms of surrender Men and officers were to be paroled but in addition there was amnesty Each officer and man will be allowed to return to his home not to be disturbed by U S authority so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may reside Lee expressed satisfaction and accepted Grant s terms At Lee s request Grant also allowed them to keep their horses 249 250 Grant ordered his troops to stop all celebration saying the war is over the rebels are our countrymen again 251 Johnston s Tennessee army surrendered on April 26 1865 Richard Taylor s Alabama army on May 4 and Kirby Smith s Texas army on May 26 ending the war 252 On April 14 1865 five days after Grant s victory at Appomattox he attended a cabinet meeting in Washington Lincoln invited him and his wife to Ford s Theater but they declined as upon his wife Julia s urging had plans to travel to Philadelphia In a conspiracy that also targeted top cabinet members in one last effort to topple the Union Lincoln was fatally shot by John Wilkes Booth at the theater and died the next morning 253 Many including Grant himself thought that he had been a target in the plot and during the subsequent trial the government tried to prove that Grant had been stalked by Booth s conspirator Michael O Laughlen 254 Stanton notified Grant of the President s death and summoned him back to Washington Vice President Andrew Johnson was sworn in as president on April 15 Attending Lincoln s funeral on April 19 Grant stood alone and wept openly he later said Lincoln was the greatest man I have ever known 255 Grant was determined to work with Johnson while he privately expressed every reason to hope in the new president s ability of running the government in its old channel 256 At the war s end Grant remained commander of the army with duties that included dealing with Maximilian and French troops in Mexico enforcement of Reconstruction in the former Confederate states and supervision of Indian wars on the western Plains 257 After the Grand Review of the Armies Lee and his generals were indicted for treason in Virginia Johnson demanded they be put on trial but Grant insisted that they should not be tried citing his Appomatox amnesty Johnson backed down so charges against Lee were dropped 258 259 Grant secured a house for his family in Georgetown Heights in 1865 but instructed Elihu Washburne that for political purposes his legal residence remained in Galena Illinois 260 That same year Grant spoke at Cooper Union in New York in support of Johnson s presidency Further travels that summer took the Grants to Albany New York back to Galena and throughout Illinois and Ohio with enthusiastic receptions 261 On July 25 1866 Congress promoted Grant to the newly created rank of General of the Army of the United States 262 Reconstruction was a turbulent period from 1863 to 1877 when former Confederate states were readmitted to the Union and fierce controversy arose over the status of both the defeated Confederates and the former slaves In November 1865 Johnson sent Grant on a fact finding mission to the South Grant recommended continuation of the Freedmen s Bureau which Johnson opposed but advised against using black troops which he believed encouraged an alternative to farm labor 263 Grant did not believe the people of the South were ready for self rule and that both whites and blacks in the South required protection by the federal government Concerned that the war led to diminished respect for civil authorities Grant continued using the Army to maintain order 264 On the same day that the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified Grant filed an unconvincing and optimistic report of his tour expressing his faith that the mass of thinking men of the South accept the present situation of affairs in good faith Grant later disavowed the report 265 In this respect Grant s opinion on Reconstruction aligned with Johnson s policy of restoring former Confederates to their positions of power arguing that Congress should allow representatives from the South to take their seats 266 Grant was initially optimistic about Johnson saying he was satisfied the nation had nothing to fear from the Johnson administration 267 Despite differing styles Grant got along cordially with Johnson and attended cabinet meetings concerning Reconstruction 267 By February 1866 the relationship began to break down 268 Johnson opposed Grant s closure of the Richmond Examiner for disloyal editorials and his enforcement of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 passed over Johnson s veto 268 Needing Grant s popularity Johnson took Grant on his Swing Around the Circle tour a failed attempt to gain national support for lenient policies toward the South 269 Grant privately called Johnson s speeches a national disgrace and he left the tour early 270 On March 2 1867 overriding Johnson s veto Congress passed the first of three Reconstruction Acts using military officers to enforce policy 271 Protecting Grant Congress passed the Command of the Army Act preventing his removal or relocation and forcing Johnson to pass orders through Grant 272 Grant wanted to replace Edwin Stanton a Radical Republican as Secretary of War but recommended against bypassing the Tenure of Office Act prohibiting a cabinet removal without Senate approval 273 Grant accepted the position not wanting the Army to fall under a conservative appointee who would impede Reconstruction and managed an uneasy partnership with Johnson 274 In December 1867 Congress voted to keep Stanton who was reinstated by a Senate Committee on Friday January 10 1868 Grant told Johnson he was going to resign office to avoid fines and imprisonment Johnson said he would assume Grant s legal responsibility and reminded Grant that he had promised him to delay his resignation until a suitable replacement was found 275 The following Monday Grant surrendered the office to Stanton 276 Johnson with the complete backing of his cabinet accused Grant of lying and duplicity at a stormy cabinet meeting while a shocked and disappointed Grant felt it was Johnson who was lying 277 The publication of angry messages between Grant and Johnson led to a complete break between the two 278 The controversy led to Johnson s impeachment and trial in the Senate 279 Johnson was saved from removal from office by one vote 280 Grant s popularity rose among the Radical Republicans and his nomination for the presidency appeared certain 281 When the Republican Party met at the 1868 Republican National Convention in Chicago the delegates unanimously nominated Grant for president and Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax for vice president 279 Although Grant had preferred to remain in the army he accepted the Republican nomination believing that he was the only one who could unify the nation 282 The Republicans advocated equal civil and political rights to all and African American enfranchisement 283 284 The Democrats having abandoned Johnson nominated former governor Horatio Seymour of New York for president and Francis P Blair of Missouri for vice president 285 The Democrats advocated the immediate restoration of former Confederate states to the Union and amnesty from all past political offenses 286 Grant played no overt role during the campaign and instead was joined by Sherman and Sheridan in a tour of the West that summer 287 However the Republicans adopted his words Let us have peace as their campaign slogan 288 Grant s 1862 General Order No 11 became an issue during the presidential campaign he sought to distance himself from the order saying I have no prejudice against sect or race but want each individual to be judged by his own merit 289 The Democrats and their Klan supporters focused mainly on ending Reconstruction intimidating Blacks and returning control of the South to the white Democrats and the planter class alienating War Democrats in the North 290 Grant won the popular vote by 300 000 votes out of 5 716 082 votes cast receiving an Electoral College landslide of 214 votes to Seymour s 80 291 Seymour received a majority of white votes but Grant was aided by 500 000 votes cast by blacks 285 winning him 52 7 percent of the popular vote 292 At the age of 46 Grant was the youngest president yet elected and the first president after the nation had outlawed slavery 293 On March 4 1869 Grant was sworn in as the eighteenth President of the United States by Chief Justice Salmon P Chase In his inaugural address Grant urged the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment while large numbers of African Americans attended his inauguration 294 He also urged that bonds issued during the Civil War should be paid in gold and called for proper treatment of Native Americans and encouraged their civilization and ultimate citizenship 295 Grant s cabinet appointments sparked both criticism and approval 296 He appointed Elihu B Washburne Secretary of State and John A Rawlins Secretary of War 297 Washburne resigned and Grant appointed him Minister to France Grant then appointed former New York Senator Hamilton Fish Secretary of State 297 Rawlins died in office and Grant appointed William W Belknap Secretary of War 298 Grant appointed New York businessman Alexander T Stewart Secretary of Treasury but Stewart was found legally ineligible to hold office by a 1789 law 299 s Grant then appointed Massachusetts Representative George S Boutwell Secretary of Treasury 297 Philadelphia businessman Adolph E Borie was appointed Secretary of Navy but found the job stressful and resigned 300 t Grant then appointed New Jersey s attorney general George M Robeson Secretary of Navy 302 Former Ohio Governor Jacob D Cox Interior former Maryland Senator John Creswell Postmaster General and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar Attorney General rounded out the cabinet 303 Grant nominated Sherman to succeed him as general in chief and gave him control over war bureau chiefs 304 When Rawlins took over the War Department he complained to Grant that Sherman was given too much authority Grant reluctantly revoked his own order upsetting Sherman and damaging their wartime friendship James Longstreet a former Confederate general who had endorsed Grant s nomination was nominated for the position of Surveyor of Customs of the port of New Orleans and was met with general amazement and seen as a genuine effort to unite the North and South 305 In March 1872 Grant signed legislation that established Yellowstone National Park the first national park 306 Grant was sympathetic to women s rights including support of female suffrage saying he wanted equal rights to all citizens 307 Grant appointed more than fifty Jewish people to federal office including consuls district attorneys and deputy postmasters 308 He appointed Edward S Salomon territorial governor of Washington the first time an American Jewish man occupied a governor s seat Grant was sympathetic to the plight of persecuted Jewish people In November 1869 reports surfaced of the Russian Czar Alexander II expelling 2 000 Jewish families to the Interior for smuggling In response Grant publicly supported the Jewish American B nai B rith petition against the Czar In December 1869 Grant appointed a Jewish journalist as Consul to Romania to protect Jewish people from severe oppression 308 In 1875 Grant proposed a constitutional amendment that limited religious indoctrination in public schools 309 Instruction of religious atheistic or pagan tenets would be banned while funding for the benefit or in aid directly or indirectly of any religious sect or denomination would be prohibited Schools would be for all children irrespective of sex color birthplace or religions 310 Grant s views were incorporated into the Blaine Amendment but it was defeated by the Senate 311 Grant was considered an effective civil rights president concerned about the plight of African Americans 312 On March 18 1869 Grant signed into law equal rights for blacks to serve on juries and hold office in Washington D C and in 1870 he signed into law the Naturalization Act that gave foreign blacks citizenship 312 During his first term Reconstruction took precedence Republicans controlled most Southern states propped up by Republican controlled Congress northern money and southern military occupation 313 u Grant advocated the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment that said states could not disenfranchise African Americans 315 Within a year the three remaining states Mississippi Virginia and Texas adopted the new amendment and were admitted to Congress 316 Grant put military pressure on Georgia to reinstate its black legislators and adopt the new amendment 317 Georgia complied and on February 24 1871 its Senators were seated in Congress with all the former Confederate states represented 318 v In 1870 to enforce Reconstruction Congress and Grant created the Justice Department that allowed the Attorney General and the new Solicitor General to prosecute the Klan 320 Congress and Grant passed a series of enforcement laws designed to protect blacks and Reconstruction governments 321 w Grant s Justice Department did destroy the Ku Klux Klan but in both his terms Blacks lost political strength in the Southern United States By October Grant suspended habeas corpus in part of South Carolina and sent federal troops to help marshals who initiated prosecutions 323 Grant s Attorney General Amos T Akerman who replaced Hoar was zealous to destroy the Klan 324 Akerman and Grant appointed Solicitor General Benjamin Bristow made hundreds of arrests while forcing 2 000 Klansmen to flee the state 325 x By 1872 the Klan s power had collapsed and African Americans voted in record numbers in elections in the South 326 y Attorney General George H Williams Akerman s replacement in the Spring of 1873 suspended prosecutions of the Klan in North Carolina and South Carolina but prior to the election of 1874 he changed course and prosecuted the Klan 328 z aa During Grant s second term the North retreated from Reconstruction while southern conservative whites called Redeemers formed armed groups the Red Shirts and the White League who openly used violence intimidation voter fraud and racist appeals to overturn Republican rule 332 Northern apathy toward blacks the depressed economy and Grant s scandals made it politically difficult for the Grant administration to maintain support for Reconstruction Power shifted when the House was taken over by the Democrats in the election of 1874 333 ab Grant ended the Brooks Baxter War bringing Reconstruction in Arkansas to a peaceful conclusion He sent troops to New Orleans in the wake of the Colfax massacre and disputes over the election of Governor William Pitt Kellogg 335 Grant recalled Sheridan and most of the federal troops from Louisiana 336 By 1875 Redeemer Democrats had taken control of all but three Southern states As violence against black Southerners escalated once more Grant s Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont told Republican Governor Adelbert Ames of Mississippi that the people were tired of the autumnal outbreaks in the South and declined to intervene directly instead sending an emissary to negotiate a peaceful election 337 Grant later regretted not issuing a proclamation to help Ames having been told Republicans in Ohio would bolt the party if Grant intervened in Mississippi 338 Grant told Congress in January 1875 he could not see with indifference Union men or Republicans ostracized persecuted and murdered 339 Congress refused to strengthen the laws against violence but instead passed a sweeping law to guarantee blacks access to public facilities 340 Grant signed it as the Civil Rights Act of 1875 but there was little enforcement and the Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional in 1883 341 In October 1876 Grant dispatched troops to South Carolina to keep Republican Governor Daniel Henry Chamberlain in office 342 Grant s Republican successor President Rutherford B Hayes was conciliatory toward the South and favored local control of civil rights on the condition that Democrats make an honorary pledge to confirm the constitutional amendments that protected blacks 343 During Republican negotiations with Democrats that Grant took no direct part in the Republicans received the White House for Hayes in return for ending enforcement of racial equality for blacks and removing federal troops from the last three states 344 As promised Hayes withdrew federal troops from South Carolina and Louisiana which marked the end of Reconstruction 345 When Grant took office in 1869 the nation s policy towards Native Americans was in chaos affecting more than 250 000 Native Americans being governed by 370 treaties 346 He appointed Ely S Parker a Seneca and member of his wartime staff Commissioner of Indian Affairs the first Native American to serve in this position surprising many around him 347 Grant s religious faith also influenced his policy towards Native Americans believing that the Creator did not place races of men on earth for the stronger to destroy the weaker 348 In April 1869 Grant signed legislation establishing an unpaid Board of Indian Commissioners to reduce corruption and oversee implementation of what was called Grant s Indian Peace policy 349 ac In 1871 Grant ended the sovereign tribal treaty system by law individual Native Americans were deemed wards of the federal government 351 ad Grant s Indian policy was undermined by Parker s resignation in 1871 denominational infighting among Grant s chosen religious agents and entrenched economic interests 352 Indian wars declined overall during Grant s first term while on October 1 1872 Major General Oliver Otis Howard negotiated peace with the Apache leader Cochise 353 Grant s Indian policy during his second term fell apart 354 On April 11 1873 Major General Edward Canby was killed in Northern California south of Tule Lake by Modoc leader Kintpuash in a failed peace conference to end the Modoc War 355 Grant ordered restraint after Canby s death the army captured Kintpuash who was convicted of Canby s murder and hanged on October 3 at Fort Klamath while the remaining Modoc tribe was relocated to the Indian Territory 355 In 1874 the army defeated the Comanche at the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon forcing them to finally settle at the Fort Sill reservation in 1875 356 Grant pocket vetoed a bill in 1874 protecting bison and supporting Interior Secretary Columbus Delano who believed correctly the killing of bison would force Plains Native Americans to abandon their nomadic lifestyle 357 ae After gold was discovered and trespassing occurred on Sioux protected lands Grant offered them 6 000 000 in October 1874 Red Cloud reluctantly entered negotiations but other Sioux chiefs readied for war 359 On November 3 1875 Grant held a meeting at the White House and under advice from Sheridan Grant agreed not to enforce keeping out miners from the Black Hills and to force hostile Native Americans onto the Sioux reservation 360 af During the Great Sioux War that started after Sitting Bull refused to relocate to agency land warriors led by Crazy Horse killed George Armstrong Custer and his men at the Battle of the Little Big Horn Grant castigated Custer in the press saying I regard Custer s massacre as a sacrifice of troops brought on by Custer himself that was wholly unnecessary wholly unnecessary 362 In September and October 1876 Grant convinced the tribes to relinquish the Black Hills Congress ratified the agreement three days before Grant left office in 1877 363 ag ah Grant was a man of peace and almost wholly devoted to domestic affairs There were no foreign policy disasters and no wars to engage in Besides Grant himself the main players in foreign affairs were Secretary of State Hamilton Fish and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Charles Sumner They had to cooperate to get a treaty ratified Sumner led the opposition to Grant s plan to annex Santo Domingo with that nation s cooperation and the measure was defeated Historians have a high regard for the professionalism independence and good judgment of Hamilton Fish The main issues involved Britain Canada Santo Domingo Cuba and Spain Worldwide it was a peaceful era with no major wars directly affecting the United States 367 ai The most pressing diplomatic problem in 1869 was the settlement of the Alabama claims depredations caused to the Union by the Confederate warship CSS Alabama built in a British shipyard in violation of neutrality rules 369 Secretary Hamilton Fish played the central role in formulating and implementing the Treaty of Washington and the Geneva arbitration 1872 370 Senator Charles Sumner Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee led the demand for reparations with talk of British Columbia as payment 371 Fish and Treasurer George Boutwell convinced Grant that peaceful relations with Britain were essential and the two nations agreed to negotiate along those lines 372 To avoid jeopardizing negotiations Grant refrained from recognizing Cuban rebels who were fighting for independence from Spain which would have been inconsistent with American objections to the British granting belligerent status to Confederates 373 aj A commission in Washington produced a treaty whereby an international tribunal would settle the damage amounts the British admitted regret but not fault 374 ak The Senate including Grant critics Sumner and Carl Schurz approved the Treaty of Washington which settled disputes over fishing rights and maritime boundaries by a 50 12 vote signed on May 8 1871 376 The Alabama claims settlement would be Grant s most successful foreign policy achievement 377 In 1869 Grant initiated his plan to annex the Dominican Republic then called Santo Domingo 378 Grant believed acquisition of the Caribbean island and Samaná Bay would increase American prosperity and U S naval protection to enforce the Monroe Doctrine safeguard against British obstruction of U S shipping and protect a future oceanic canal while blacks would have a safe haven from the crime of Klu Kluxism 379 Joseph W Fabens an American speculator who represented Buenaventura Báez the president of the Dominican Republic met with Secretary Fish and proposed annexation 380 whose island inhabitants sought American protection 381 Fish wanted nothing to do with the island but he dutifully brought up Faben s proposal to Grant at a cabinet meeting 382 On July 17 Grant sent his military White House aide Orville E Babcock to evaluate the islands resources local conditions and Báez s terms for annexation but was given no diplomatic authority 383 When Babcock returned to Washington with two unauthorized annexation treaties Grant however approved and pressured his cabinet to accept them 384 al Grant ordered Fish to draw up formal treaties sent to Báez by Babcock s return to the island nation The Dominican Republic would be annexed for 1 5 million and Samaná Bay would be lease purchased for 2 million On November 29 President Báez signed the treaties On December 21 the treaties were placed before Grant and his cabinet 386 On December 31 Grant met with Senator Charles Sumner Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee SFRC at his Washington D C home to gain his support for annexation Grant left confident Sumner approved however what Sumner said was disputed The controversial episode led to hostility between the two men On January 10 1870 Grant submitted the treaties to the SFRC for ratification but Sumner purposely neglected the bills 387 Prompted by Grant to stop stalling the treaties Sumner s committee took action but rejected the bills by a 5 to 2 vote Sumner sent the treaties for a full Senate vote while Grant personally lobbied other senators Despite Grant s efforts the Senate defeated the treaties on Thursday June 30 by a 28 28 vote when a 2 3 majority was required 388 Sumner had previously led Grant to believe that he would support the treaties Grant was outraged and on Friday July 1 1870 he removed his appointed Minister to Great Britain John Lothrop Motley Sumner s friend knowing he could not pacify Sumner 389 In January 1871 Grant signed a joint resolution to send a commission to investigate annexation 390 For this undertaking he chose three neutral parties with Fredrick Douglass to head the commission 391 Although the commission approved its findings the Senate remained opposed forcing Grant to abandon further efforts 392 am The stinging controversy over Santo Domingo overshadowed Grant s foreign diplomacy 377 American policy was to remain neutral during the Ten Years War 1868 78 a series of long bloody revolts that were taking place in Cuba against Spanish rule The U S refused to recognize the belligerence of the rebels and in effect endorsed Spanish colonial rule there while calling for the abolition of slavery in Cuba 394 This policy was shaken in October 1873 when a Spanish cruiser captured a merchant ship Virginius flying the U S flag carrying supplies and men to aid the insurrection Spanish authorities executed the prisoners including eight American citizens and many Americans called for war with Spain Grant ordered U S Navy Squadron warships to converge on Cuba off of Key West supported by the USS Kansas On November 27 Fish reached a diplomatic resolution in which Spain s president Emilio Castelar y Ripoll expressed his regret surrendered the Virginius and the surviving captives A year later Spain paid a cash indemnity of 80 000 to the families of the executed Americans 395 396 In the face of strong opposition from Democrats Grant and Fish secured a free trade treaty in 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii incorporating the Pacific islands sugar industry into the United States economic sphere 397 Soon after taking office Grant took conservative steps to return the nation s currency to a more secure footing 373 During the Civil War Congress had authorized the Treasury to issue banknotes that unlike the rest of the currency were not backed by gold or silver The greenback notes as they were known were necessary to pay the unprecedented war debts but they also caused inflation and forced gold backed money out of circulation Grant was determined to return the national economy to pre war monetary standards 398 On March 18 1869 he signed the Public Credit Act of 1869 that guaranteed bondholders would be repaid in coin or its equivalent while greenbacks would gradually be redeemed by the Treasury and replaced by notes backed by specie The act committed the government to the full return of the gold standard within ten years 399 This followed a policy of hard currency economy and gradual reduction of the national debt Grant s own ideas about the economy were simple and he relied on the advice of wealthy and financially successful businessman that he courted 373 In April 1869 railroad tycoons Jay Gould and Jim Fisk conspired to corner the gold market in New York the nation s financial capital 400 They controlled the Erie Railroad and a high price of gold would allow foreign agriculture buyers to purchase exported crops shipped east over the Erie s routes 401 Boutwell s bi weekly policy of selling gold from the Treasury however kept gold artificially low 402 Unable to corrupt Boutwell the two schemers built a relationship with Grant s brother in law Abel Corbin and gained access to Grant 403 Gould bribed Assistant Treasurer Daniel Butterfield 10 000 to gain insided information into the Treasury 404 an ao Gould and Fisk personally lobbied Grant on board their private yacht from New York to Boston in mid June 1869 to influence Grant s gold policy 406 ap In July Grant reduced the sale of Treasury gold to 2 000 000 per month and subsequent months 407 Fisk played a role in August in New York having a letter from Gould he told Grant his gold policy would destroy the nation 408 By September Grant who was naive in matters of finance was convinced that a low gold price would help farmers and the sale of gold for September was not increased 409 On September 23 when the gold price reached 143 1 8 Boutwell rushed to the White House and talked with Grant 410 The following day September 24 known as Black Friday Grant ordered Boutwell to sell whereupon Boutwell wired Butterfield in New York to sell 4 000 000 in gold 411 The bull market at Gould s Gold Room collapsed the price of gold plummeted from 160 to 133 1 3 a bear market panic ensued Gould and Fisk fled for their own safety while severe economic damages lasted months 412 By January 1870 the economy resumed its post war recovery 413 aq Grant s first administration was mixed with both success and failure 415 In 1871 to placate reformers he created the America s first Civil Service Commission chaired by reformer George William Curtis 416 The Liberal Republicans composed of reformers men who supported low tariffs and those who opposed Grant s prosecution of the Klan broke from Grant and the Republican Party 417 The Liberals who personally disliked Grant detested his alliance with Senator Simon Cameron and Senator Roscoe Conkling considered to be spoilsmen politicians 418 In 1872 the Liberals nominated Horace Greeley a leading Republican New York Tribune editor and a fierce enemy of Grant for president and Missouri governor B Gratz Brown for vice president 419 The Liberals denounced Grantism corruption nepotism and inefficiency demanded the withdrawal of federal troops from the South literacy tests for blacks to vote and amnesty for Confederates 420 The Democrats adopted the Greeley Brown ticket and the Liberals party platform 421 ar Greeley whose Tribune gave him wider name recognition and a louder campaign voice pushed the themes that the Grant administration was failed and corrupt 423 The Republicans nominated Grant for reelection with Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts replacing Colfax as the vice presidential nominee 424 as The Republicans shrewdly borrowed from the Liberals party platform including extended amnesty lowered tariffs and embraced civil service reform 426 Grant lowered customs duties gave amnesty to former Confederates and implemented a civil service merit system neutralizing the opposition 427 To placate the burgeoning suffragist movement the Republicans platform mentioned women s rights would be treated with respectful consideration 428 Concerning Southern policy Greeley advocated local government control be given to whites while Grant advocated federal protection of blacks 429 Grant was supported by Frederick Douglass prominent abolitionists and Indian reformers 430 Grant won reelection easily thanks to federal prosecution of the Klan a strong economy debt reduction lowered tariffs and tax reductions 431 He received 3 6 million 55 6 votes to Greeley s 2 8 million votes and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66 432 at A majority of African Americans in the South voted for Grant while Democratic opposition remained mostly peaceful 435 Grant lost in six former slave states that wanted to see an end to Reconstruction 436 He proclaimed the victory as a personal vindication of his presidency but inwardly he felt betrayed by the Liberals 437 Grant was sworn in for his second term by Salmon P Chase on March 4 1873 In his second inaugural address he reiterated the problems still facing the nation and focused on what he considered the chief issues of the day freedom and fairness for all Americans while emphasizing the benefits of citizenship for freed slaves Grant concluded his address with the words My efforts in the future will be directed towards the restoration of good feelings between the different sections of our common community 438 au In 1873 Wilson suffered a stroke never fully recovering he died in office on November 22 1875 440 av With Wilson s loss Grant relied on Fish s guidance more than ever 442 Grant continued to work for a strong dollar signing into law the Coinage Act of 1873 which effectively ended the legal basis for bimetallism the use of both silver and gold as money establishing the gold standard in practice 443 aw The Coinage Act discontinued the standard silver dollar and established the gold dollar as the sole monetary standard because the gold supply did not increase as quickly as the population the result was deflation Silverites who wanted more money in circulation to raise the prices that farmers received denounced the move as the Crime of 1873 claiming the deflation made debts more burdensome for farmers 445 Economic turmoil renewed during Grant s second term In September 1873 Jay Cooke Company a New York brokerage house collapsed after it failed to sell all of the bonds issued by Cooke s Northern Pacific Railway The collapse rippled through Wall Street and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad stocks and bonds were also ruined 446 On September 20 the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading for ten days 447 Grant who knew little about finance traveled to New York to consult leading businessmen and bankers for advice on how to resolve the crisis which became known as the Panic of 1873 448 Grant believed that as with the collapse of the Gold Ring in 1869 the panic was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers 449 He instructed the Treasury to buy 10 million in government bonds injecting cash into the system The purchases curbed the panic on Wall Street but an industrial depression later called the Long Depression nonetheless swept the nation 448 Many of the nation s railroads 89 out of 364 went bankrupt 450 Congress hoped inflation would stimulate the economy and passed what became known as the Inflation Bill in 1874 Many farmers and workingmen favored the bill which would have added 64 million in greenbacks to circulation but some Eastern bankers opposed it because it would have weakened the dollar 451 Belknap Williams and Delano ax told Grant a veto would hurt Republicans in the November elections Grant believed the bill would destroy the credit of the nation and he vetoed it despite their objections Grant s veto placed him in the conservative faction of the Republican Party and was the beginning of the party s commitment to a gold backed dollar 453 Grant later pressured Congress for a bill to further strengthen the dollar by gradually reducing the number of greenbacks in circulation When the Democrats gained a majority in the House after the 1874 elections the lame duck Republican Congress did so before the Democrats took office 454 On January 14 1875 Grant signed the Specie Payment Resumption Act which required gradual reduction of the number of greenbacks allowed to circulate and declared that they would be redeemed for gold beginning on January 1 1879 455 ay The post Civil War economy brought on massive industrial wealth and government expansion Speculation lifestyle extravagance and corruption in federal offices were rampant 457 All of Grant s executive departments were investigated by Congress 458 Grant by nature was honest trusting gullible and extremely loyal His responses to malfeasance were mixed at times appointing cabinet reformers but also at times defending culprits 459 Grant in his first term appointed Secretary of Interior Jacob D Cox who implemented civil service reform he fired unqualified clerks and took other measures 460 On October 3 1870 Cox resigned office under a dispute with Grant over handling of a mining claim 461 az Authorized by Congress on March 3 1871 Grant created the first Civil Service Commission 463 The Commission advocated competitive exams and the end of mandatory political assessments 464 which took effect the next year but Department heads and others were exempted 465 ba In November 1871 Grant s appointed New York Collector and Conkling ally Thomas Murphy resigned Grant replaced Murphy with another Conkling ally Chester A Arthur who implemented Boutwell s reforms 467 A Senate committee investigated the New York Customs House from January 3 1872 to June 4 1872 This led to Grant firing warehouse owner George K Leet for charging exorbitant freight fees and splitting the profits 468 Although exonerated Grant was derided for his association with Conkling s New York patronage machine 469 On March 3 1873 Grant signed into law an appropriation act that increased pay for federal employees Congress the Judiciary and the President 470 Grant s annual salary doubled from 25 000 to 50 000 Publically derided the law was partially repealled but Grant kept his much needed pay raise 471 Grant s personal reputation remained intact 472 In 1872 Grant signed into law an act that ended private moiety tax collection contracts but an attached rider allowed three more contracts 473 Boutwell s assistant secretary William A Richardson hired John B Sanborn to go after individuals and cooperations who allegedly evaded taxes Retained by Richardson as Secretary Sanborn aggressively collected 427 000 in supposed delinquent taxes keeping half for himself splitting 160 000 of his money with others 474 During an 1874 Congressional investigation Richardson denied involvement but Sanborn said he met with Richardson six times over the contracts 475 Congress severely condemned Richardson s permissive manner Grant appointed Richardson judge of the Court of Claims and replaced him with reformer Benjamin Bristow 476 In June Grant and Congress abolished the moiety system 477 Bristow effectively cleaned house tightened up the Treasury s investigation force implemented civil service and fired hundreds of corrupt appointees 478 Bristow discovered Treasury receipts were low and launched an investigation that uncovered the notorious Whiskey Ring that involved collusion between distillers and Treasury officials to evade paying the Treasury millions in tax revenues 479 Much of this money was being pocketed while some of it went into Republican coffers 480 Bristow informed Grant of the ring in mid April and on May 10 Bristow struck 481 Federal marshals raided 32 installations nationwide and arrested 350 men 176 indictments were obtained leading to 110 convictions and 3 150 000 in fines returned to the Treasury 482 Grant appointed David Dyer under Bristow s recommendation federal attorney to prosecute the Ring in St Louis who indicted Grant s old friend General John McDonald supervisor of Internal Revenue 483 Grant endorsed Bristow s investigation writing on a letter Let no guilty man escape 484 Bristow s investigation discovered Babcock received kickback payments and that Babcock had secretly forewarned McDonald the ring s mastermind boss of the coming investigation 485 On November 22 the jury convicted McDonald 486 On December 9 Babcock was indicted however Grant refused to believe in Babcock s guilt was ready to testify in Babcock s favor but Fish warned that doing so would put Grant in the embarrassing position of testifying against a case prosecuted by his own administration 487 Instead Grant remained in Washington and on February 12 1876 gave a deposition in Babcock s defense expressing that his confidence in his secretary was unshaken 488 Grant s testimony silenced all but his strongest critics 489 The St Louis jury acquitted Babcock but there was enough evidence revealed that Grant reluctantly dismissed him from the White House although Babcock kept his position of Superintendent of Public Buildings in Washington 490 bb The Interior Department under Secretary Columbus Delano whom Grant appointed to replace Cox was rife with fraud and corrupt agents and Delano was forced to resign Surveyor General Silas Reed had set up corrupt contracts that benefited Delano s son John Delano 492 Grant s Secretary Interior Zachariah Chandler who succeeded Delano in 1875 implemented reforms fired corrupt agents and ended profiteering 493 When Grant was informed by Postmaster Marshall Jewell of a potential Congressional investigation into an extortion scandal involving Attorney General George H Williams wife Grant fired Williams and appointed reformer Edwards Pierrepont in his place Grant s new cabinet appointments temporarily appeased reformers 494 After the Democrats took control of the House in 1875 more corruption in federal departments was exposed 495 Among the most damaging scandal involved Secretary of War William W Belknap who took quarterly kickbacks from the Fort Sill tradership which led to his resignation in February 1876 496 Belknap was impeached by the House but was acquitted by the Senate 497 Grant s own brother Orvil set up silent partnerships and received kickbacks from four trading posts 498 Congress discovered that Secretary of Navy Robeson had been bribed by a naval contractor but no articles of impeachment were drawn up 499 In his December 5 1876 Eighth Annual Message Grant apologized to the nation and admitted mistakes were made Failures have been errors of judgement not of intent 500 The abandonment of Reconstruction by the nation played a central role during the Election of 1876 501 Mounting investigations into corruption by the House controlled by the Democrats politically discredited Grant s presidency 502 Grant by a public letter in 1875 chose not to run for a third term while the Republicans chose Governor Rutherford B Hayes of Ohio a reformer at their convention 503 The Democrats nominated Governor Samuel J Tilden of New York Voting irregularities in three Southern states caused the election that year to remain undecided for several months 504 Grant told Congress to settle the matter through legislation and assured both sides that he would not use the army to force a result except to curb violence On January 29 1877 he signed legislation forming an Electoral Commission to decide the matter 505 Hayes was ruled President by the Commission to forestall Democratic protests Republicans agreed to the Compromise of 1877 in which the last troops were withdrawn from Southern capitals With Reconstruction dead an 80 year era of Jim Crow segregation was launched 506 Grant s calm visage through out the election crisis appeased the nation 507 To the chagrin of Grant President Hayes appointed Reconstruction critics including Liberal Republican icon Carl Schurz to Secretary of Interior 508 After leaving the White House Grant said he was never so happy in my life The Grants left Washington for New York to attend the birth of their daughter Nellie s child staying at Hamilton Fish s residence Calling themselves waifs the Grants toured Cincinnati St Louis Chicago and Galena without a clear idea of where they would live afterwards 509 For some years Grant had entertained the idea of taking a long deserved vacation after his presidency and after liquidating one of his investments to finance the venture the Grants set out on a world tour that lasted approximately two and a half years 510 Grant s voyage abroad was funded by a Nevada based mining company investment he made that earned him 25 000 511 600 000 in 2019 dollars 512 Preparing for the tour they arrived in Philadelphia on May 10 1877 and were honored with celebrations during the week before their departure On May 16 Grant and Julia left for England aboard the SS Indiana 513 During the tour the Grants made stops in Europe Africa India and points in the Middle East and Far East meeting with notable dignitaries such as Queen Victoria Pope Leo XIII Otto von Bismarck Emperor Meiji and others Grant was the first U S president to visit Jerusalem and the Holy Land 514 As a courtesy to Grant by the Hayes administration his touring party received federal transportation on three U S Navy ships a five month tour of the Mediterranean on the USS Vandalia travel from Hong Kong to China on the USS Ashuelot and transportation from China to Japan on the USS Richmond 515 During the tour the Hayes administration encouraged Grant to assume a public unofficial diplomatic role to represent the United States and strengthen American interests abroad while resolving issues for some countries in the process 516 Homesick the Grants left Japan sailing on the SS City of Tokio escorted by a Japanese man of war crossed the Pacific and landed in San Francisco on September 20 1879 greeted by cheering crowds 517 Before returning home to Philadelphia Grant stopped at Chicago for a reunion with General Sherman and the Army of the Tennessee 518 Grant s tour demonstrated to much of the world that the United States was an emerging world power 519 Stalwarts led by Grant s old political ally Roscoe Conkling saw Grant s renewed popularity as an opportunity to regain power and sought to nominate him for the presidency in 1880 Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two term rule in use since George Washington Grant said nothing publicly but wanted the job and encouraged his men 520 Washburne urged him to run Grant demurred saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win with another candidate though he preferred James G Blaine to John Sherman Even so Conkling and John A Logan began to organize delegates in Grant s favor When the convention convened in Chicago in June there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate but he was still short of a majority vote to get the nomination 521 At the convention Conkling nominated Grant with an eloquent speech the most famous line being When asked which state he hails from our sole reply shall be he hails from Appomattox and its famous apple tree 522 With 370 votes needed for nomination the first ballot had Grant at 304 Blaine at 284 Sherman at 93 and the rest to minor candidates 523 Subsequent ballots followed with roughly the same result neither Grant nor Blaine could win After thirty six ballots Blaine s delegates deserted him and combined with those of other candidates to nominate a compromise candidate Representative James A Garfield of Ohio 524 A procedural motion made the vote unanimous for Garfield who accepted the nomination 525 Grant gave speeches for Garfield but declined to criticize the Democratic nominee Winfield Scott Hancock a general who had served under him in the Army of the Potomac 526 Garfield won the election Grant gave Garfield his public support and pushed him to include Stalwarts in his administration 527 On July 2 1881 Garfield was shot by an assassin and died on September 19 On learning of Garfield s death from a reporter Grant wept bitterly 528 When Grant had returned to America from his costly world tour he had depleted most of his savings and needed to earn money and find a new home 529 Wealthy friends bought him a home on Manhattan s Upper East Side and to make an income Grant Jay Gould and former Mexican Finance Secretary Matías Romero chartered the Mexican Southern Railroad with plans to build a railroad from Oaxaca to Mexico City Grant urged Chester A Arthur who had succeeded Garfield as president in 1881 to negotiate a free trade treaty with Mexico Arthur and the Mexican government agreed but the United States Senate rejected the treaty in 1883 The railroad was similarly unsuccessful falling into bankruptcy the following year 530 At the same time Grant s son Buck had opened a Wall Street brokerage house with Ferdinand Ward although a confidence man who swindled numerous wealthy men Ward was at the time regarded as a rising star on Wall Street The firm Grant Ward was initially successful 531 In 1883 Grant joined the firm and invested 100 000 of his own money 532 Grant however warned Ward that if his firm engaged in government business he would dissolve their partnership 533 To encourage investment Ward paid investors abnormally high interest by pledging the company s securities on multiple loans in a process called rehypothecation 534 Ward in collusion with banker James D Fish and kept secret from bank examiners retrieved the firm s securities from the company s bank vault 535 When the trades went bad multiple loans came due all backed up by the same collateral Historians agree that Grant was likely unaware of Ward s intentions but it is unclear how much Buck Grant knew In May 1884 enough investments went bad to convince Ward that the firm would soon be bankrupt Ward who assumed Grant was a child in business matters 536 told him of the impending failure but assured Grant that this was a temporary shortfall 537 Grant approached businessman William Henry Vanderbilt who gave him a personal loan of 150 000 538 Grant invested the money in the firm but it was not enough to save it from failure Essentially penniless but compelled by a sense of personal honor he repaid what he could with his Civil War mementos and the sale or transfer of all other assets 539 Vanderbilt took title to Grant s home although he allowed the Grants to continue to reside there and pledged to donate the souvenirs to the federal government and insisted the debt had been paid in full 540 Grant was distraught over Ward s deception and asked privately how he could ever trust any human being again 541 In March 1885 as his health was failing he testified against both Ward and Fish 542 Ward was convicted of fraud in October 1885 months after Grant s death and served six and a half years in prison 543 After the collapse of Grant Ward there was an outpouring of sympathy for Grant 544 Throughout his career Grant repeatedly told highly detailed stories of his military experiences often making slight mistakes in terms of dates and locations As a poor hardscrabble farmer in St Louis just before the war he kept his neighbors spellbound till midnight listening intently to his vivid narrations of Army experiences 545 In calm moments during the Civil War he often spoke of his recent experiences typically in terse and often eloquent language 546 Grant s interpretations changed over time in his letters written during the Mexican War period there is no criticism of the war By contrast his Memoirs are highly critical of the political aspects condemning the war as unwarranted aggression by the United States Grant told and retold his war stories so many times that writing his Memoirs was more a matter of repetition and polish rather than trying to recall his memories for the first time 547 bc In the summer of 1884 Grant complained of a sore throat but put off seeing a doctor until late October when he learned it was cancer possibly caused by his frequent cigar smoking 549 bd Grant chose not to reveal the seriousness of his condition to his wife who soon found out from Grant s doctor 551 Before being diagnosed Grant was invited to a Methodist service for Civil War veterans in Ocean Grove New Jersey on August 4 1884 receiving a standing ovation from more than ten thousand veterans and others it would be his last public appearance 552 In March of the following year The New York Times announced that Grant was dying of cancer and a nationwide public concern for the former president began 553 be Grant was nearly broke and worried constantly about leaving his wife a suitable amount of money to live on Century magazine offered Grant a book contract with a 10 percent royalty but Grant s friend Mark Twain understanding how bad Grant s financial condition was made him an offer for his memoirs which paid an unheard of 75 percent royalty 555 To provide for his family Grant worked intensely on his memoirs at his home in New York City His former staff member Adam Badeau assisted him with much of the research while his son Frederick located documents and did much of the fact checking 556 Because of the summer heat and humidity his doctors recommended that he move upstate to a cottage at the top of Mount McGregor offered by a family friend 557 Grant finished his memoir and died only a few days later 558 Grant s memoirs treat his early life and time in the Mexican American War briefly and are inclusive of his life up to the end of the Civil War 559 The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S Grant was a critical and commercial success Julia Grant received about 450 000 in royalties equivalent to 12 800 000 in 2019 555 The memoir has been highly regarded by the public military historians and literary critics 560 Grant portrayed himself in the persona of the honorable Western hero whose strength lies in his honesty and straightforwardness He candidly depicted his battles against both the Confederates and internal army foes 561 bf After a year long struggle with throat cancer surrounded by his family Grant died at 8 08 a m in the Mount McGregor cottage on July 23 1885 at the age of 63 563 Sheridan then Commanding General of the Army ordered a day long tribute to Grant on all military posts and President Grover Cleveland ordered a thirty day nationwide period of mourning After private services the honor guard placed Grant s body on a special funeral train which traveled to West Point and New York City A quarter of a million people viewed it in the two days before the funeral Tens of thousands of men many of them veterans from the Grand Army of the Republic GAR marched with Grant s casket drawn by two dozen black stallions 564 to Riverside Park in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan His pallbearers included Union generals Sherman and Sheridan Confederate generals Simon Bolivar Buckner and Joseph E Johnston Admiral David Dixon Porter and Senator John A Logan the head of the GAR 565 Following the casket in the seven mile long 11 km procession were President Cleveland the two living former presidents Hayes and Arthur all of the President s Cabinet as well as the justices of the Supreme Court 566 Attendance at the New York funeral topped 1 5 million 565 Ceremonies were held in other major cities around the country while Grant was eulogized in the press and likened to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln 567 Grant s body was laid to rest in Riverside Park first in a temporary tomb and then twelve years later on April 17 1897 in the General Grant National Memorial also known as Grant s Tomb the largest mausoleum in North America 565 Grant was hailed across the North as the winning general in the American Civil War and overall his military reputation has held up fairly well Achieving great national fame for his victories at Vicksburg and the surrender at Appomattox he was widely credited as the General who saved the Union Criticized by the South for using excessive force his overall military reputation stands intact 568 Grant s drinking was often exaggerated by the press and falsely stereotyped by many of his rivals and critics 569 Grant s reputation fell when the popularity of the pro Confederate Lost Cause theory and the Dunning School movement grew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries 570 In the 1950s some historians made a reassessment of Grant s military career shifting the analysis of Grant as the victor by brute force to that of successful skillful modern strategist and commander 571 William S McFeely won the Pulitzer Prize for his critical 1981 biography that credited Grant s initial presidential efforts on civil rights but lamented his failure to carry out lasting progress 572 However historians still debate how effective Grant was at halting corruption 573 The scandals during the Grant administration were often used to stigmatize his political reputation 574 In the 21st century Grant s reputation among historians has improved markedly starting with Jean Edward Smith s 2001 Grant biography 575 Opinions of Grant s presidency demonstrate a better appreciation of Grant s personal integrity Reconstruction efforts and peace policy towards Indians even when they fell short 576 577 578 Ronald White said Grant demonstrated a distinctive sense of humility moral courage and determination and as president he stood up for African Americans especially fighting against voter suppression perpetuated by the Ku Klux Klan 579 White s American Ulysses 2016 and Ron Chernow s Grant 2017 continued the elevation of Grant s historical reputation 580 Some historians while noting some of Grant s presidential successes question whether Grant s revived reputation among scholars has been found in the popular consciousness 581 Several memorials honor Grant In addition to his mausoleum Grant s Tomb in New York City there is the Ulysses S Grant Memorial at the foot of Capitol Hill in Washington D C 582 Created by sculptor Henry Merwin Shrady and architect Edward Pearce Casey and dedicated in 1922 it overlooks the Capitol Reflecting Pool 583 In 2015 restoration work began which is expected to be completed before the bicentennial of Grant s birth in 2022 584 The Ulysses S Grant National Historic Site near St Louis and several other sites in Ohio and Illinois memorialize Grant s life 585 The U S Grant Cottage State Historic Site located at the top of Mount McGregor in Wilton New York preserves the house in which he completed his memoirs and died 586 587 There are smaller memorials in Chicago s Lincoln Park and Philadelphia s Fairmount Park Named in his honor are Grant Park as well as several counties in western and midwestern states On June 3 1891 a bronze statue of Grant by Danish sculptor Johannes Gelert was dedicated at Grant Park in Galena Illinois 588 589 From 1890 to 1940 part of what is now Kings Canyon National Park was called General Grant National Park named for the General Grant sequoia 590 In May 2012 the Ulysses S Grant Foundation on the institute s fiftieth anniversary selected Mississippi State University as the permanent location for Ulysses S Grant s presidential library 591 592 Historian John Y Simon edited Grant s letters into a 32 volume scholarly edition published by Southern Illinois University Press 593 Grant s image has appeared on the front of the United States fifty dollar bill since 1913 In 1921 the Ulysses S Grant Centenary Association was founded with the goal of coordinating special observances and erecting monuments in recognition of Grant s historical role The venture was financed by the minting of 10 000 gold dollars depicted below and 250 000 half dollars The coins were minted and issued in 1922 commemorating the 100th anniversary of Grant s birth 594 595 Grant has also appeared on several U S postage stamps the first one issued in 1890 five years after his death 596 Biographical Military politics Primary
