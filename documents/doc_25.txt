The LSWR N15 class was a British 2 cylinder 4 6 0 express passenger steam locomotive designed by Robert W Urie The class has a complex build history spanning three sub classes and eight years of construction from 1918 to 1927 The first batch of the class was constructed for the London and South Western Railway LSWR where they hauled heavy express trains to the south coast ports and further west to Exeter After the Lord Nelsons they were the second biggest 4 6 0 passenger locomotives on the Southern Railway Following the grouping of railway companies in 1923 the LSWR became part of the Southern Railway SR and its publicity department gave the N15 locomotives names associated with Arthurian legend the class hence becoming known as King Arthurs 2 The Chief Mechanical Engineer CME of the newly formed company Richard Maunsell modified the Urie locomotives in the light of operational experience and increased the class strength to 74 locomotives Maunsell and his Chief Draughtsman James Clayton incorporated several improvements notably to the steam circuit and valve gear The new locomotives were built over several batches at Eastleigh and Glasgow leading to the nicknames of Eastleigh Arthurs and Scotch Arthurs in service The class was subjected to smoke deflection experiments in 1926 becoming the first British class of steam locomotive to be fitted with smoke deflectors Maunsell s successor Oliver Bulleid attempted to improve performance by altering exhaust arrangements The locomotives continued operating with British Railways BR until the end of 1962 One example 30777 Sir Lamiel is preserved as part of the National Collection and can be seen on mainline railtours Robert Urie completed his H15 class mixed traffic 4 6 0 design in 1913 and the prototype was built in August 1914 It showed a marked improvement in performance over Dugald Drummond s LSWR T14 class 4 6 0 when tested on local and express passenger trains The introduction of ten H15 engines into service coincided with the outbreak of the First World War which prevented construction of further class members Despite the interruption caused by the conflict Urie anticipated that peacetime increases in passenger traffic would necessitate longer trains from London to the south west of England Passenger loadings on the heavy boat trains to the London and South Western Railway s LSWR ports of Portsmouth Weymouth and Southampton had been increasing prior to the war and was beginning to overcome the capabilities of the LSWR s passenger locomotive fleet 3 His response was to produce a modern standard express passenger design similar to the H15 4 Trials undertaken in 1914 with the H15 class prototype had demonstrated to Urie that the basic design showed considerable speed potential on the Western section of the LSWR from Basingstoke westwards and could form the basis of a powerful new class of 4 6 0 express passenger locomotive with larger 6 ft 7 in 2 01 m driving wheels 2 5 The LSWR required such a locomotive which would need to cope with increasing train loads on this long and arduous route to the West Country 2 The result was the N15 class design completed by Urie in 1917 It incorporated features from the H15 class including eight wheel double bogie tenders with outside plate frames over the wheels and exposed Walschaerts valve gear 5 High running plates along the boiler were retained for ease of oiling and maintenance 4 5 6 Despite the similarities the N15 class represented a refinement of the H15 template The cylinders were increased in size to 22 in 28 in 560 mm 710 mm in diameter the largest used on a British steam locomotive at that time 4 The substantial boiler design was also different from the parallel version used on the H15 and became the first tapered types to be constructed at Eastleigh Works 4 Contrary to boiler construction practices elsewhere where tapering began near the firebox it was restricted to the front end of the N15 s barrel to reduce the diameter of the smokebox and consequently the weight carried by the front bogie 4 The design also featured Urie s design of narrow diameter stovepipe chimney a large dome cover on top of the boiler and his Eastleigh superheater 7 The N15 design was approved by the LSWR management committee though the order for construction was postponed until wartime control of raw materials was relaxed 4 Government approval was obtained in mid 1918 and Eastleigh Works began to produce the LSWR s first new locomotive class since 1914 4 The first locomotives later known by crewmen as the Urie N15s were built in two ten engine batches by the LSWR s Eastleigh Works between 1918 19 and 1922 23 8 Of the first batch the prototype No 736 entered service on 31 August 1918 with four more appearing between September 1918 and April 1919 4 They shared a similar profile to Urie s H15 class with the use of flat sided Drummond style cabs with gently curving roofs The double bogie tenders were outwardly similar in appearance to those used on the H15s although strengthened during construction with extra internal bracing to hold 5 000 imperial gallons 22 700 l of water 7 A shortage of copper delayed completion of Nos 741 745 and the last of the batch emerged from Eastleigh in November 1919 9 After the running in of Nos 736 745 and an intensification of the LSWR timetable to the West Country a second batch of ten was ordered in October 1921 9 They entered service over the period June 1922 March 1923 and were numbered in the series 746 755 9 At Grouping in January 1923 the LSWR became part of the new Southern Railway whose Chief Mechanical Engineer was Richard Maunsell Maunsell planned to introduce his own designs of express passenger locomotive one of which was to become the future Lord Nelson class 10 Despite this there was a short term need to maintain existing services that required modification and expansion of Urie s N15 design 6 Maunsell s projected design of express passenger locomotive was not ready for introduction during the summer timetable of 1925 so a third batch of ten N15s was ordered for construction at Eastleigh This batch was part of an outstanding LSWR order to rebuild 15 of Drummond s unsuccessful 4 cylinder F13 G14 and P14 classes 4 6 0s into 2 cylinder H15 class locomotives 6 Only the five F13s were converted to H15s the remaining ten G14 and P14s Nos 448 457 renumbered E448 E457 were rebuilt as N15s implementing modifications to Urie s original design 11 The modifications are attributed to Maunsell s Chief Draughtsman James Clayton who had transferred to Ashford railway works in 1914 from Derby works They were the result of cooperation between the South Eastern and Chatham Railway SECR and the Great Western Railway GWR when Maunsell was seconded to the Railway Executive Committee during the First World War 11 The aim was to create a series of standard freight and passenger locomotives for use throughout Britain and meant that Clayton was privy to the latest GWR developments in steam design These included streamlined steam passages long travel valves the maximisation of power through reduced cylinder sizes and higher boiler pressure 11 Maunsell initiated trials with Urie N15 No 442 in 1924 and proved that better performance could be obtained by altering the steam circuit valve travel and draughting arrangements 6 As a result Clayton reduced the N15 cylinder diameter to 20 5 inches 520 mm and replaced the safety valves with Ross pop valves set to 200 psi 1 38 MPa boiler pressure 12 The Urie boiler was retained though the Eastleigh superheater was replaced by a Maunsell type with 10 per cent greater superheating surface area 6 This was supplemented by a larger steam chest and an increased diameter chimney casting specially designed for the rebuilds 13 It incorporated a rim and capuchon to control exhaust flow into the atmosphere 13 Valve events the timing of valve movements with the piston were also revised to promote efficient steam usage and the wheels were re balanced to reduce hammerblow 12 14 When rebuilding was complete only the numbers smokebox doors with centre tightening handles and the flat sided cabs remained of the G14 and P14 classes 13 The rebuilds retained their distinctive Drummond watercart tenders which were modified with the removal of the complex injector feedwater heating equipment 6 The watercart tenders were of 4 300 imp gal 19 500 l water and 5 00 long tons 5 1 t coal capacity 12 The ten rebuilds became the first members of the King Arthur class upon entering service 11 As the Drummond G14 and P14 4 6 0s were rebuilt to the N15 specification at Eastleigh a lack of production capacity due to repair and overhaul meant that Maunsell ordered a further batch of 20 locomotives from the North British Locomotive Company in 1924 15 The company had under quoted to gain the contract which meant that production of the batch was rushed 16 The necessity to maintain an intensive timetable on the Southern Railway s Western section prompted an increase of the order to 30 locomotives Nos E763 E792 16 Their construction in Glasgow would gain them the Scotch Arthurs nickname in service 10 They were all delivered to the Southern Railway by October 1925 and featured the front end refinements used on the Drummond rebuilds 6 The North British batch was built to the Southern s new composite loading gauge and differed from previous batches in having an Ashford style cab based upon that used on the N class 6 Unlike the Drummond cab retained by Nos 448 457 and E741 E755 the Ashford cab was of an all steel construction and had a roof that was flush with the cab sides allowing it to be used on gauge restricted routes in the east of the network 11 It was inspired by the standard cab developed in 1904 by R M Deeley for the Midland Railway and was one of a number of Midland features introduced by Clayton to the SECR and subsequently the Southern Railway 6 The smokebox door was revised to the Ashford pattern which omitted the use of central tightening handles in favour of clamps around the circumference 12 The batch was fitted with the Urie designed North British built 5 000 imp gal 22 700 l capacity double bogie tenders 11 With the Scotch Arthurs in service the Southern Railway had an ample fleet of express passenger locomotives for its Western section routes As part of a process of fleet standardisation the Operating Department expressed a desire replace obsolescent locomotives on the Eastern and Central sections with the King Arthur class 17 In May 1925 a batch of 25 locomotives Nos E793 E817 based upon the Scotch Arthurs was ordered for construction at Eastleigh with smaller firebox grates and improved water heating surfaces 18 After the first 14 Nos E793 E806 were built it was decided to discontinue construction in favour of Maunsell s new 4 cylinder Lord Nelson class design in June 1926 17 The Operating Department intended to equip Nos E793 E807 with six wheel 4 000 imp gal 18 200 l capacity tenders for use on the former SECR lines of the Eastern section 19 These were to replace Scotch Arthurs Nos E763 E772 on boat train duties 19 This was because the 5 000 imp gal 22 700 l tenders attached to Nos E763 E772 were better suited to the longer routes of the Western section 17 The final ten engines Nos E808 E817 were for the former LBSCR routes of the Central section where short turntables restricted tender size to the 3 500 imp gal 15 900 l Ashford variety used on the N class 17 After the order was changed to the Lord Nelson class design 14 N class tenders were fitted to Nos E793 E806 for use the Central section 17 The high draw gear the link between locomotive and tender of the N class tenders necessitated modification to the frames beneath the cab 18 When the former Drummond G14 and P14 4 6 0s were rebuilt to Maunsell s N15 specification in February 1925 the Southern Railway decided to give names to all express passenger locomotives Because of the railway s association with the West of England the Public Relations Officer John Elliot suggested that members of the N15 class should be named after characters and places associated with the legend of King Arthur 10 When Maunsell was told of the decision to name the locomotives he replied Tell Sir Herbert Walker I have no objection but I warn you it won t make any difference to the working of the engines 20 Walker was the General Manager of the Southern Railway who had told Elliot that Maunsell s permission was required The first G14 to be rebuilt No E453 was given the first name and christened King Arthur The Urie locomotives hitherto referred as N15s rather than King Arthurs were also given names connected with Arthurian legend and were referred to as Urie Arthurs the Maunsell batches of N15s were nicknamed the Eastleigh and Scotch Arthurs 20 The N15 class was intended to haul heavy expresses over the long LSWR mainlines between Waterloo Weymouth Exeter and Plymouth 21 Locomotives were changed at Salisbury before the upgrading of the South Western Mainline in 1922 when fast running through to Exeter was possible 22 The Southern Railway s motive power re organisation following the Grouping of 1923 saw the class allocated to sheds across the network and used on Bournemouth to Oxford cross country trains 23 Operations were expanded to more restricted Central and Eastern section mainlines in 1925 and suitably modified class members hauled commuter and heavy boat trains from London Victoria to Dover Marine and expresses to Brighton 21 In 1931 No E780 Sir Persant hauled the inaugural Bournemouth Belle Pullman train from Waterloo to Bournemouth West 24 In peacetime the class was occasionally used on fast freights from Southampton Docks although it was common to see them at the head of freight and troop trains during the Second World War Ten Urie Arthurs were transferred to the London and North Eastern Railway LNER in October 1942 and were based at Heaton shed for use on freight and occasional passenger trains in the north east and southern Scotland 25 They returned to the Southern Railway in July 1943 after the introduction of United States Army Transportation Corps S160 class 2 8 0s into service 25 From 1945 the King Arthur class regularly deputised for Bulleid s new Pacifics which were experiencing poor serviceability due to mechanical failures The entire class came into British Railways ownership in 1948 they could be found in most areas of the Southern Region on medium length expresses and stopping trains on the ex LSWR mainline 26 In 1926 the N15 class became the first in Britain equipped with smoke deflectors with several designs tested 27 28 Experiments were undertaken throughout 1926 and included the fitting of a curved plate above the smokebox of No E753 Melisande to channel air from below the chimney to lift the exhaust above the locomotive when on the move 29 Nos E450 Sir Kay and E753 Sir Gillemere had air scoops attached to the chimney whilst E772 Sir Percivale was fitted with large square German type smoke deflectors 30 Finally No E453 King Arthur was fitted with small rectangular smoke deflectors fitted to the handrails on the smokebox sides 31 The experiments produced mixed results and Maunsell requested the assistance of the University of London in staging wind tunnel tests 23 These resulted in a standard plate design illustrated in the infobox which was gradually fitted to the class from late 1927 onwards 28 Under LSWR ownership the N15s were initially well received by crews though the batch soon gained a reputation for poor steaming on long runs 6 Through running of the class into Exeter was stopped in favour of engine changes at Salisbury and Urie attributed the problem to poor driving technique 9 A series of trial runs changed this assumption and demonstrated that steam pressure gradually decreased on the flat 6 The trials also revealed that the robust construction of the motion produced the heaviest hammerblow of any British locomotive class and had caused cracked frames on the test locomotive 32 Another criticism from locomotive crews concerned the exposed cab in bad weather which necessitated the installation of a tarpaulin sheet over the rear of the cab and the front of the tender restricting rearward vision 33 The 1921 Coal Miners strike meant that two class members Nos 737 and 739 were converted to oil burning 9 One of the modified locomotives subsequently caught fire at Salisbury shed and both were reverted to coal firing by the end of the year 9 When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923 Urie had done little to remedy the shortcomings of the N15s and it fell to his successor to improve the class 9 When Maunsell inherited the design as CME of the Southern Railway he began trials using the weakest N15 No 442 in 1924 22 The results indicated that better performance could be obtained by altering the steam circuit valve travel and draughting arrangements although the first two recommendations were deemed too costly for immediate implementation by the Locomotive Committee 22 Eight extra King Arthur type boilers were ordered from North British and fitted to N15s Nos 737 742 by December 1925 in an effort to improve steaming 23 The remaining Urie boilers were fitted with standard Ross pop safety valves to ease maintenance 13 Maunsell also addressed draughting problems caused by the narrow Urie stovepipe chimney 6 The exhaust arrangements were modified on No 737 using the King Arthur chimney design and reduced diameter blastpipes 13 This proved successful and all Urie N15s were modified over the period 1925 1929 34 The oil burning equipment was refitted to Nos 737 and 739 during the 1926 General Strike and removed in December of that year 23 Beginning in 1928 all but No 755 had their cylinder diameter reduced from 22 inches 560 mm to 21 inches 530 mm when renewals were due improving speed on flat sections of railway but affecting their performance on the gradients west of Salisbury 18 No 755 The Red Knight was modified in 1940 by Maunsell s successor Oliver Bulleid with his own design of 21 inch 530 mm cylinders and streamlined steam passages This was married to a Lemaître multiple jet blastpipe and wide diameter chimney allowing the locomotive to produce performances akin to the more powerful Lord Nelson class 35 Four other N15s were so modified with four more on order though the latter were cancelled due to wartime shortages of metal 19 The soft exhaust of the Lemaître multiple jet blastpipe precipitated an adjustment to the smoke deflectors on three converted locomotives with the tops angled to the vertical in an attempt to improve air flow along the boiler cladding 19 This failed to achieve the desired effect and the final two modified locomotives retained the Maunsell style deflectors 35 The final modifications to the Urie N15s involved the conversion of five locomotives Nos 740 745 748 749 and 752 to oil firing in 1946 1947 36 This was in response to a government scheme to address a post war coal shortage 36 The oil tanks were fabricated from welded steel and fitted within the tender coal space 36 After initial problems with No 740 Merlin were rectified the oil fired locomotives proved good performers on Bournemouth services 36 A further addition to the oil fired locomotives was electric headcode and cab lighting which was retained when the engines reverted to coal firing in 1948 36 The improved front end layout applied to the first batch of Eastleigh Arthurs Nos E448 E457 ensured continuous fast running on flat sections of track around London although their propensity for speed was sometimes compromised over the hilly terrain west of Salisbury 37 The inside bearings of the Drummond watercart tenders proved problematic as they were too small for the load carried and suffered from water ingress 31 The retention of the tall Drummond cab prevented use away from the Western section of the Southern Railway 31 Despite these problems their operational reliability prompted the management to arrange the visit of No E449 Sir Torre to the Darlington Railway Centenary celebrations in July 1925 38 No E449 also recorded speeds of up to 90 mph 140 km h on the South West Mainline near Axminster in 1929 37 This proved that with the right components Urie s original design could perform well 2 Despite the successful use of modified N15 components to rebuild Nos E448 E457 the mechanically similar Scotch Arthurs proved disappointing when put into service from May 1925 12 The performance of those allocated to the Eastern section was indifferent and failed to improve upon the double headed ex SECR 4 4 0s they were to replace 12 Reports of poor steaming and hot driving and tender wheel axleboxes were common from crewmen and shed fitters 12 After investigation the problems were attributed to poor workmanship during construction as the North British Locomotive Company underquoted production costs to gain the contract 16 Defects were found in boiler construction across the batch and necessitated six replacement boilers re riveting re fitting of tubes and replacement of firebox stays 16 The hot driving wheel axleboxes were caused by the main frames being out of alignment 16 A 1926 report suggested that all affected locomotives should be taken to Eastleigh for repair 16 Once repaired the Scotch Arthurs proved as capable as the rest of the class in service 2 Scotch Arthurs Nos E763 E772 received new tenders between 1928 and 1930 in a series of tender exchanges with the Lord Nelson and LSWR S15 classes 39 This ensured that they could exchange their Urie 5 000 imp gal 22 700 l bogie tenders with the 4 000 imp gal 18 200 l Ashford design for use on the shorter Eastern section routes 17 Whilst useful for the roster clerks at Battersea shed any transfer to the Western section was hampered because of their shorter range 17 By 1937 all had reverted to the Urie 5 000 imp gal 22 700 l bogie tenders though Nos E768 E772 were attached to new Maunsell flush sided tenders with brake vacuum reservoirs fitted behind the coal space 39 These were again swapped with Maunsell LSWR style bogie tenders fitted to the Lord Nelson class 39 The second batch of Eastleigh Arthurs displaced the ex K class tanks and ex LBSCR H2 Atlantic 4 4 2 locomotives on the Eastbourne and Bognor Regis routes respectively 17 They were well liked by crews and used on this part of the network until the arrival of electrification 40 No E782 Sir Brian was used on the former Great Northern main line for performance trials against the SECR K and K1 class tanks following a railway accident at Sevenoaks Kent in 1927 41 The tests were supervised by the London and North Eastern Railway s CME Sir Nigel Gresley who commented that the class was unstable at high speeds 42 The instability was caused by motion hammerblow and exacerbated by irregularities in track work 41 This caused excessive stress to the axleboxes and poor riding characteristics on the footplate 43 Despite this the class benefited from an excellent maintenance regime 40 Maunsell s replacement Oliver Bulleid believed that there was little need to improve draughting on this series However reports of poor steaming with No 792 Sir Hervis de Revel gave him an opportunity to trial a Lemaître multiple jet blastpipe and wide diameter chimney on a Maunsell Arthur in 1940 44 This did not enhance performance to the extent of No 755 The Red Knight 44 Under British Railways ownership the locomotive was re fitted with the Maunsell chimney in March 1952 with no further problems reported 45 In another wartime experiment Bulleid fitted No 783 Sir Gillemere with three thin stovepipe chimneys in November 1940 46 These were set in a triangular formation to reduce visibility of exhaust from the air in response to attacks made by low flying aircraft on Southern Railway trains 44 The stovepipes were reduced to two producing a fierce exhaust blast that dislodged soot inside tunnels and under bridges 46 The experiment was discontinued in February 1941 and the locomotive re fitted with a Maunsell King Arthur chimney 44 The last experiment was with spark arresting equipment in response to lineside fires caused by poor quality coal 47 Nos 784 Sir Nerovens and 788 Sir Urre of the Mount were fitted with new wide diameter chimneys in late 1947 47 Test trains showed mixed results and the trials were stopped in 1951 after improvements in coal quality and the fitting of internal smokebox spark arrestors 47 The detail variations across the class meant the Urie N15s were placed into store over the winters of 1949 and 1952 48 The Maunsell King Arthur examples were easier to maintain and the large number of modern Bulleid Pacific and British Railways Standard classes were able to undertake similar duties 49 The Urie N15s were brought into service during the summer months although their deteriorating condition was demonstrated when No 30754 The Green Knight was withdrawn with cracked frames in 1953 48 The slow running down of the Urie N15s continued between 1955 1957 and several were stored prior to withdrawal 26 The last three were withdrawn from Basingstoke shed with No 30738 King Pellinore the final example to cease operation in March 1958 26 All were broken up for scrap though their names were given to 20 BR Standard class 5 locomotives allocated to the Southern Region between 1959 1962 26 The Maunsell King Arthur class also faced a decrease in suitable work on the Central and Eastern sections following the introduction of BR Standard class 5 and BR Standard class 4 4 6 0s in 1955 50 The gradual withdrawal of the Urie N15s H15s and SR N15x classes presented an opportunity to replace the ageing Drummond watercart tenders fitted to Nos 448 457 with Urie 5 000 imp gal 22 700 l bogie tenders 50 This coincided with a 1958 programme to similarly change the 3 500 imp gal 15 900 l Ashford tenders fitted to eight of the second batch Eastleigh Arthurs 51 The class remained intact until the completion of the Eastern section electrification when 17 were made redundant in 1959 10 More withdrawals took place in 1960 when an increase in Bulleid Pacifics allocated to the Western section reduced available work 52 The ranks thinned to 12 in 1961 and further withdrawals reduced the class to one No 30770 Sir Prianius 52 The class outlasted the newer but less numerous Lord Nelson class by one month when No 30770 was withdrawn from Basingstoke Shed in November 1962 10 53 Under LSWR ownership the Urie N15s were painted in Urie s LSWR sage green livery for passenger locomotives 58 This was distinct from Drummond s sage green because it was more olive in colour and yellowed with cleaning and weathering 58 Black and white lining decorated the boiler bands and borders of the sage green panels 58 The lettering was in gilt the initials LSWR located on the side of the tender the locomotive number on the cabside 59 The first Southern livery continued that of the LSWR though with primrose yellow transfers showing SOUTHERN and the locomotive number placed on the tender 58 The lining separating the black border on tender and cab side panels was changed to yellow 58 Primrose yellow transfers showing SOUTHERN and the locomotive number were placed on the tender 59 An E prefix was located above the tender number e g E749 denoting that the class was registered for maintenance at Eastleigh works 58 The gilt numerals on the cabside and tender rear were replaced by a cast oval plate with Southern Railway around the edge and the number located in the centre Yellow numerals were painted onto the front buffer beam to ease identification 59 In February 1925 Maunsell developed a deeper green with black and white lining 59 This was applied to his new King Arthur class locomotives and the Urie N15s were similarly painted when overhauls were due 59 Wheels were olive green with black tyres 59 From 1929 the E prefix was removed and the cast numerals on the tender rear were removed and replaced with yellow transfers e g 749 58 In May 1938 after Bulleid s appointment as CME No 749 Iseult was trialled in bright unlined light green with yellow painted block numerals replacing the cast numberplates 58 The tender was given two designs of lettering with SOUTHERN on one side and the initials SR on the other 58 The Board of Directors disapproved and Bulleid repainted the locomotive in darker malachite green with black and white lining this would later be applied to his Pacifics 58 The legend SOUTHERN in block lettering remained on the tender though the number was relocated to the cabside on one side and the smoke deflector on the other 60 Both were painted in a light sunshine yellow No 749 was returned to Maunsell s green livery 60 Several variations of the Maunsell green Urie sage green and Bulleid malachite green liveries were tried with black white black and yellow lining some sporting a green panel on the smoke deflectors 60 However from 1942 to 1946 during the Second World War members of the class under overhaul were turned out in unlined black livery as a wartime economy measure with green shaded sunshine yellow lettering 61 The final Southern livery used from 1946 reverted to malachite green with yellow black lining and sunshine yellow lettering Some of the class Nos 782 and 800 Sir Brian and Sir Persant did not receive this livery 61 British Railways gave the class the power classification of 5P after nationalisation in 1948 62 For the first 18 months the locomotives sported a transitional livery Southern Railway malachite green with BRITISH RAILWAYS on the tender in sunshine yellow lettering 63 As each member of the class became due for a heavy general overhaul they were repainted in the new standard British Railways express passenger livery of Brunswick green with orange and black lining from April 1949 63 Initially the British Railways Cycling Lion crest was located on the tender replaced from the 1957 by the later Ferret and Dartboard crest 62 Numbering was initially a continuation of the Southern Railway system though an S prefix was added to denote a pre nationalisation locomotive so that No 448 would become No s448 63 As each locomotive became due for overhaul and received its new livery the numbering was changed to the British Railways standard numbering system in the series 30448 30457 for the first ten and 30736 30806 for the rest 64 After the poor steaming of the Urie batch was addressed the class proved popular amongst crews mechanically reliable and capable of high speeds 10 However their heavy hammerblow at speed meant that they were prone to rough riding and instability The two Maunsell batches with their streamlined steam passages and better draughting arrangements were superior in performance and were a popular choice when Bulleid s locomotives were unavailable 65 Their use of standard parts considerably eased maintenance and the fitting of different tender and cab sizes meant few operational restrictions for the class on mainline routes 10 The class gave many years of service and were noted for their ability to do the job 65 The electrification of the Eastern and Central sections and the increasing number of Bulleid Pacifics in service meant the lack of a suitable role for the class under British Railways ownership 66 In spite of the reduction in work high mileages were obtained with No 30745 Tintagel achieving 1 464 032 miles 2 356 131 km in service 67 The decision to preserve a member of the class was made in November 1960 68 It was first intended to preserve the King Arthur class doyen No 453 King Arthur and it was stored for a time after withdrawal in 1961 pending restoration to museum condition 69 However it was decided to restore the preserved locomotive to as built condition and the lack of a suitable Drummond watercart tender precluded this consideration 69 No 453 was subsequently scrapped and it was decided to preserve one of the North British built batch No 30777 Sir Lamiel withdrawn in October 1961 instead 69 Sir Lamiel was named after a character in Thomas Malory s Le Morte d Arthur Sir Lamiel of Cardiff 70 This locomotive was restored to Maunsell livery as No E777 and became part of the National Collection 71 It was restored to the later British Railways livery in 2003 and No 30777 can be seen at the Great Central Railway and on the railway network hauling mainline railtours as of 2010 72 Hornby Railways manufacture a
