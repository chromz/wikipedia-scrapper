Tomahawks had by this time been replaced by Kittyhawks and Gibbes emblazoned his with a cartoon depicting a kangaroo kicking a dachshund in the rear 8 26 He claimed a Bf 109 possibly a misidentified Macchi C 202 during the Siege of Tobruk on 7 May 8 27 On 26 May he was shot down while leading an attack on a heavily escorted force of Luftwaffe bombers near El Adem After firing at and probably destroying a Bf 109 Gibbes was hit by fire from a Ju 88 and had to bail out Part of his parachute became entangled with the tailplane of his stricken aircraft and he struggled to escape 8 28 He broke his ankle in the landing but within six weeks was flying again his leg still in a cast 12 29 Due to his enforced absence fellow ace Nicky Barr was given command of No 3 Squadron until he himself was shot down and taken prisoner on 26 June at which point Gibbes again took charge of the unit 11 28 Barr later said that although Gibbes was not a brilliant shot he had the keenest eyesight of any pilot he knew when it came to locating enemy aircraft and alerting his fellows for the attack 30 Another No 3 Squadron pilot Tom Russell agreed that Gibbes was particularly adept at finding targets and said that if we got scattered in a dogfight he had the uncanny ability to get us back into formation in a very short space of time 31 Gibbes was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross DFC on 28 July 1942 for his actions on 26 May the citation noting his exceptional skill and gallantry 32 On 1 September he destroyed a Bf 109 and damaged two others during the Battle of Alam el Halfa east of El Alamein

captured from the Germans and came away impressed 12 20 He was credited with another Bf 109 on 17 November 23 On 21 December he landed his Kittyhawk in rugged terrain near Hun Libya to rescue a fellow pilot who had been forced down Gibbes threw out his own parachute to make room in the cockpit for his passenger and lost part of his undercarriage taking off necessitating a one wheeled landing back at base 37 38 Recommended for the Victoria Cross for this action he was instead awarded the Distinguished Service Order which was promulgated on 15 January 1943 and cited his outstanding qualities of leadership and enthusiasm 29 39 Gibbes crash landed behind enemy lines on 14 January 1943 walking 50 miles 80 km in the desert before being picked up by a British Army patrol 37 40 He was awarded a bar to his DFC for this feat and for his exceptional leadership skill and courage contributing in a large measure to the success of the squadron he commands 41 The award made him the most highly decorated pilot in the RAAF 1 On 22 January 1943 Gibbes claimed his last kill a C 202 23 He was officially credited with 10¼ victories 42 43 also reported as a score of 12 including 2 shared 6 12 40 44 He was further credited with 5 probables and another 16 damaged 12 44 During his tour of duty in the Middle East he flew 274 sorties and became No 3 Squadron s longest serving wartime commanding officer 6 20 Squadron member Bob Smith recalled him as lacking somewhat in administrative ability but an Errol Flynn in the air 45 Gibbes for his part later admitted to being in an absolute state of terror before missions only to sort of become mechanical once the shooting started 46 He described his post combat feelings thus 47 Man becomes animal when he thinks he is about to die As you fly back to your base now safe at last a feeling of light hearted exuberance comes over you It is wonderful to still be alive and it is I think merely the after effect of violent terrible fear Gibbes handed over command of No 3 Squadron to Squadron Leader Brian Eaton on 19 April 1943 38 48 His rank of squadron leader confirmed the same month Gibbes departed North Africa to serve at RAAF Overseas Headquarters London until October 11 While in England he converted to de Havilland Mosquito night fighters and was slated to command No 464 Squadron RAAF but was instead posted back to Australia via Canada 2 There according to Gibbes he gave a series of morale building lectures on air combat to Empire Air Training Scheme students So I you know went round and lied like hell I said that it was all a piece of cake 49 In January 1944 he joined No 2 Operational Training Unit OTU at Mildura Victoria becoming chief flying instructor in March 2 11 He worked with Clive Caldwell Australia s top scoring ace to improve the success rate at No 2 OTU by personally selecting the most promising pilots from local service flying training schools 50 Gibbes was promoted to temporary wing commander on 1 July In October he was posted to Darwin in the Northern Territory flying Supermarine Spitfires as wing leader of No 80 Wing 11 51 The role made him deputy to Group Captain Caldwell the wing s commanding officer 51 Gibbes later suffered burns in a crash landing following engine failure 40 In December he met in his own words a little dark haired popsy named Jeannine Ince a volunteer with the Red Cross who had nursed him in hospital 6 29 They married on 23 January 1945 2 No 80 Wing had begun transferring to the Dutch East Indies in December 1944 and the main body followed in January 1945 Gibbes injuries prevented him from joining the formation at its base on Morotai where it came under the control of the Australian First Tactical Air Force No 1 TAF until 9 March Once there he took over as temporary commanding officer for a few days when Caldwell was called to Manila 52 In April Gibbes was one of eight senior pilots including Caldwell and fellow aces Wilf Arthur and John Waddy who tendered their resignations in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground attack missions The incident became known as the Morotai Mutiny 53 54 Gibbes said later after I myself had been operating for a week or so and had a really good look around and seen the futility of the operations which had been given I could not see any point in carrying on I certainly lost all keenness for remaining in the service As a former jackaroo he was especially upset about one sortie that involved attacking cattle I felt horrible about it being an ex bushy at about lunch time I went out and darned if I didn t have to turn butcher And Heavens it was butchering too in every sense of the word No not the Japs Cattle If we are to get the Japs out of this area without loss of human lives starvation will be our main weapon God I hated doing it but could do nothing else Felt as sick as hell 55 No action was taken against the mutineers for their attempted resignations a subsequent government inquiry found that their protest was justified In the meantime Gibbes and Caldwell were court martialled for their involvement in alcohol trafficking on Morotai 29 53 Both were reduced to the rank of flight lieutenant the Air Officer Commanding No 1 TAF Air Commodore Harry Cobby himself shortly to be dismissed over the mutiny restored Gibbes to squadron leader effective 23 April 56 57 In July 1945 Gibbes was assigned to the staff of RAAF Headquarters Melbourne 11 Following his discharge from the Air Force on 11 January 1946 he was initially employed as a stock and station agent in Coonamble New South Wales 9 58 He flew a Butler Bat twin engined aircraft to facilitate his work reportedly the only New South Welshman in his profession to do so at the time 59 Gibbes spent much of the next 30 years in New Guinea pioneering the island s transport coffee and hospitality industries In January 1948 he formed Gibbes Sepik Airways using among other types three German Junkers Ju 52s one of which was said to have been the personal transport of senior Luftwaffe commander Albert Kesselring 20 58 He was joined briefly in this venture headquartered at Wewak by Nicky Barr 60 Gibbes also established a tea and coffee plantation at Mount Hagen New Guinea in 1950 and served as a member of the RAAF Active Reserve based in Townsville Queensland from 1952 until 1957 40 61 In 1958 he sold his share in Gibbes Sepik Airways to Mandated Airlines which was later bought out by Ansett Australia He continued to develop coffee plantations in New Guinea and built a large chain of hotels beginning with the Bird of Paradise in Goroka 6 29 Gibbes sold his interests in New Guinea in 1972 58 He spent most of the remainder of the decade in the Mediterranean aboard his catamaran Billabong 58 In his 60s he sailed Billabong from England to Australia by himself braving heavy seas and Malaysian pirates along the way 6 29 By 1979 he was living in Sydney and had begun building his own twin engined plane which he eventually took to the air in 1990 58 In 1994 Gibbes published his autobiography You Live But Once He continued to fly until forced to give up his civil aviation licence at the age of 85 6 In 2002 he appeared in an episode of the television series Australian Story dedicated to Nicky Barr 62 Gibbes was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia on 26
