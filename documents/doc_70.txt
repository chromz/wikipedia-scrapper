weather Whilst flying alone in a mist he forced an enemy aeroplane to land On two occasions flying at an altitude of 200 feet he made very valuable reconnaissances and his reports on the general situation were of the greatest value His leadership is excellent and he has set a high example to his flight No 2 Squadron converted to Royal Aircraft Factory S E 5s in January 1918 10 The unit generally conducted patrols with flights of six aircraft but found it difficult to lure enemy fighters into combat so after a lull in fighting early in February it began flying two plane missions which yielded better results 18 The following month as the German Spring Offensive got under way Phillipps shot down three German fighters in as many days a Fokker Triplane on 22 March an Albatros the next morning and a two seater on 24 March the official history of Australia in the war recorded that the last mentioned enemy lost its wings to Phillipps machine gun fire and fell like a stone With the Allies holding clear superiority over the German fighters the main danger to the Australians was from ground fire as most combat took place at low level and their machines came back full of bullet holes 19 On 27 March Phillipps achieved two more victories a Triplane that he sent down in flames near Albert and another German fighter over Méaulte 20 He was recommended for a bar to his Military Cross on 31 March 21 and the award was gazetted on 22 June 22 Capt Roy Cecil Phillipps M C Aust F C attd R F C For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty When engaged with hostile aircraft during

10 24 His victims included two Fokker Triplanes one of which he attacked head on an LVG and a Fokker D VII flown by Fritz Loerzer commander of Jasta 26 and an eleven victory ace who was captured 4 25
