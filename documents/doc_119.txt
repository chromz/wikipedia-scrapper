General Hastings Lionel Ismay 1st Baron Ismay KG GCB CH DSO PC DL 21 June 1887 17 December 1965 nicknamed Pug was a British Indian Army officer and diplomat remembered primarily for his role as Winston Churchill s chief military assistant during the Second World War and his service as the first Secretary General of NATO from 1952 to 1957 Ismay was born in Nainital India in 1887 and educated in the United Kingdom at the Charterhouse School and Royal Military College Sandhurst After Sandhurst he joined the Indian Army as an officer of the 21st Prince Albert Victor s Own Cavalry During the First World War he served with the Camel Corps in British Somaliland where he joined in the British fight against the Mad Mullah Mohammed Abdullah Hassan In 1925 Ismay became an Assistant Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence CID After being promoted to the rank of colonel he served as the military secretary for Lord Willingdon the Viceroy of India then returned to the CID as Deputy Secretary in 1936 On 1 August 1938 shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War Ismay became the Committee s Secretary and began planning for the impending war In May 1940 when Winston Churchill became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom he selected Ismay as his chief military assistant and staff officer In that capacity Ismay served as the principal link between Churchill and the Chiefs of Staff Committee Ismay also accompanied Churchill to many of the Allied war conferences For Ismay s advice and aid Churchill owed more and admitted that he owed more to him than to anybody else military or civilian in the whole of the war 1 After the end of the war Ismay remained in the army for another year and helped to reorganise the Ministry of Defence He then retired from the military and served as Lord Mountbatten of Burma s Chief of Staff in India helping to oversee its partition From 1948 to 1951 he served as chairman of the council of the Festival of Britain helping to organise and promote the event Then in 1951 when Churchill again became Prime Minister he appointed Ismay Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations Ismay accepted the position but resigned after only six months to become the first Secretary General of NATO in 1952 He served in this role until 1957 and helped establish and define the position After retiring from NATO Ismay wrote his memoirs The Memoirs of General Lord Ismay served on a variety of corporate boards and co chaired the Ismay Jacob Committee which reorganised the Ministry of Defence once again He died on 17 December 1965 at his home Wormington Grange Gloucestershire Ismay was born in Nainital India on 21 June 1887 His father Sir Stanley Ismay was a member of the Viceroy s Legislative Council and his mother Beatrice Ellen was the daughter of an Army colonel 2 Ismay began his education in Britain at the Charterhouse School and his parents hoped that after completing his education there he would attend Cambridge and enter the civil service 3 Ismay however had a sneaking desire to be a cavalry soldier and after doing poorly on his final examinations at Charterhouse he was not eligible to attend Cambridge As a result he entered the Royal Military College Sandhurst in 1904 3 Ismay would later write Sandhurst never meant nearly so much to me as Charterhouse had but he enjoyed his time at the school and studied alongside many men who went on to become important military officers including Lord Gort Edgar Ludlow Hewitt and Cyril Newall 4 After completing the course at Sandhurst Ismay was placed fourth overall in its examinations and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Indian Army 4 Ismay was then attached to the Gloucestershire Regiment of the British Army in Ambala where he served a one year mandatory apprenticeship After leaving the regiment Ismay did not immediately find a place in the Indian cavalry so he spent nine months floating among positions with various British and Indian units 5 6 In 1907 Ismay found a permanent position in the Indian cavalry joining the 21st Prince Albert Victor s Own Cavalry 7 based at Risalpur Ismay thoroughly enjoyed his time with the regiment describing it as blissful 8 In 1908 he saw his first action with the regiment when it was sent into Afghanistan pursuing Mohmand raiders who had taken several Hindu women as hostages 9 Immediately after Ismay s regiment returned from action he was hospitalised in Peshawar due to heat stroke but he recovered quickly and along with the rest of his regiment received the India General Service Medal 10 In 1910 after a reorganisation of the Indian Army Ismay s regiment moved from Risalpur to Jhelum further from the frontier Shortly thereafter Ismay was appointed the adjutant of his regiment a position which he held for four years during which time he also read voraciously and developed a great admiration for Winston Churchill whom he sought to emulate 11 12 In early 1914 just before Ismay s appointment as adjutant was set to expire he met C A L Howard another British officer serving in India who told him about an opportunity to serve with the King s African Rifles in British Somaliland Ismay decided that this was just the sort of job that he wanted and applied immediately 13 Due to his reputation as a thorough and dependable officer of sound judgement Ismay was appointed second in command of the Somaliland Camel Corps a cavalry unit led by Thomas Cubitt 14 Ismay left India for Somaliland in late July 1914 and arrived on 9 August shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in Europe 15 16 Like other officers in Somaliland Ismay was unhappy at being left out of the great war 17 and repeatedly asked for a transfer to the European front 18 In the end however Ismay s superiors decided that he was so indispensable that despite his longing for action in Europe he was retained in Somaliland until 1920 14 In Somaliland the Camel Corps and other British soldiers were ordered to subdue an uprising by Mohammed Abdullah Hassan known by the British as the Mad Mullah who had been fighting against them for more than twenty years Ismay s commander Thomas Cubitt was determined to end the rebellion forcefully and quickly so on 17 November 1914 he launched a major assault against Hassan s fortress at Shimber Berris 19 In the attack Ismay fought closely alongside Adrian Carton de Wiart later an important British officer in both World Wars 20 Not long after the attack on Shimber Berris however the Camel Corps received orders from London forbidding all offensive operations in Somaliland due to the misfortunes of the Army elsewhere 21 As a result of this order British operations were limited for the duration of the First World War and Ismay s unit undertook no further major offensives 22 Despite limited British activity a few operations combined with the effort of local forces led to a drastic weakening of Hassan s forces by 1918 23 Thus after the armistice ending the First World War the government sent Major General Arthur Hoskins to take control of the forces in Somaliland and defeat Hassan conclusively in battle 24 After Hoskins arrived his initial plan for dealing with Hassan focussed on the use of the newly formed Royal Air Force so Ismay and the Camel Corps were consigned to a minor role Hoskins s plans however were found overscaled and far too costly so they were shelved throughout most of 1918 and 1919 25 In October 1919 plans for Hoskins s operation were finally approved 26 and on 21 January 1920 the attack against Hassan commenced 27 After several days of bombing Ismay was ordered to lead an assault by the Camel Corps against Hassan s fortress at Jid Ali 28 On 27 January Ismay s forces first attempted the attack and were repulsed by strong resistance That night however Hassan and his forces fled Jid Ali to take refuge in the countryside 29 Ismay was assigned to track down and capture Hassan but he had no idea of where he was and was forced to begin a large search 30 31 Ismay pursued Hassan for nearly two weeks and managed to capture many members of his family and people close to him including seven of his sons 32 Nonetheless Hassan himself managed to evade Ismay and on 12 February the effort to capture him was called off 33 Though Hassan was never captured his power was broken and he died in December 1920 of influenza 34 For his service in the effort against Hassan Ismay received the Distinguished Service Order 35 and was twice mentioned in despatches 36 37 38 In April 1920 Ismay left Somaliland for England While en route he received word that he had been nominated for a place at the Indian Army s Staff College in Quetta 39 Depressed by the loss of life and destruction of the First World War Ismay turned down the nomination and was even seriously thinking of resigning his commission in the Army 40 After arriving in London Ismay was given twelve months of medical leave and decided to stay in the army 41 He then attempted to reclaim his seat at the Staff College but was told that it had already been given to someone else 42 While on medical leave Ismay met Laura Kathleen Clegg with whom he quickly fell in love 7 The two were engaged only three weeks after meeting 43 After four months however Ismay was proclaimed fit for duty despite his remaining eight months of leave and ordered back to India where he rejoined his old regiment His time back in India was relatively quiet as there was no serious fighting in the area of his regiment at the time In February 1921 Ismay took the qualifying exam for the Staff College in Rawalpindi and passed earning himself a seat for the next year 44 45 In April Ismay returned to London on leave and married Clegg with whom he eventually had three daughters 7 Ismay remained in London until February 1922 when he entered the Staff College at Quetta 46 Ismay excelled at the Staff College and its commandant called him one of the two best if not the best of the students who have passed through my hands 7 47 In his final thesis at the Staff College Ismay correctly predicted that the next European war would be a total war but he incorrectly predicted that cavalry would continue to play a role in future warfare 46 After the Staff College Ismay became Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General of the Indian Army 48 In that position he worked closely with Claude Auchinleck beginning a long standing personal and professional relationship between the two 49 50 Ismay found that his work as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General was a valuable experience but did not enjoy it 51 In 1924 Air Vice Marshal Philip Game suggested to Ismay that he apply for a seat at the RAF Staff College Andover Although Ismay had no desire to learn to be a pilot he was happy for the opportunity to return to England and went to study at the college 51 52 After completing the programme he was approached about the possibility of serving as an Assistant Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence CID under Maurice Hankey Ismay gladly accepted the position starting work in December 1925 53 In the six months between finishing the Staff College and beginning at the CID Ismay returned to India and held a staff position at the headquarters of the Indian Army in Simla 54 As Assistant Secretary Ismay directed several of the CID s subcommittees including those for Censorship and War Emergency Legislation Principal Supply Officers and Co ordination of Departmental Action 55 As the Secretary of the Committee for the Co ordination of Departmental Action Ismay was responsible for seeing that all plans and preparations made by Government Departments or sub committees of the CID to meet the eventuality of war were incorporated under appropriate headings in a document known as the War Book 56 This task ended up consuming most of Ismay s time as Assistant Secretary and gave him exceptional insight into the ways of Whitehall 7 While serving as Assistant Secretary Ismay made important friends and gained the backing of Hankey by whom he was greatly valued Largely through Hankey s influence Ismay was nominated as a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the Civil Division 57 58 an honour which he received in 1931 59 In December 1930 after five years Ismay left his position at the CID 60 61 He was promoted colonel 59 and hoped to take command of the 12th Cavalry 62 Instead he became the military secretary for Lord Willingdon the newly appointed Viceroy of India 59 In this role Ismay served as the unofficial link between Willingdon and the Indian Army He also led Willingdon s personal staff and organised his many trips throughout India Ismay was also responsible for Willingdon s safety and took precautions after he was threatened by assassins 63 64 In December 1932 Ismay was informed that his service with Willingdon was over and that he was expected to take up a position in the War Office during the next year 65 At the War Office Ismay served as an intelligence officer with responsibility for the Middle East Far East the Americas the Soviet Union Poland and the Baltic States Ismay enjoyed his work and wrote that intelligence is perhaps the most interesting of all Staff work 66 During his three years in the position Ismay worked directly under Sir John Dill who would later serve as the Chief of the Imperial General Staff 67 In 1936 Maurice Hankey became determined to bring Ismay in as his deputy and eventual successor at the CID 68 Hoping that the appointment would strengthen the organization of the CID and enhance its influence Hankey offered Ismay the position of Deputy Secretary 69 Although the appointment meant that Ismay would probably never command troops again he viewed it as an important opportunity and accepted with scarcely a moment s hesitation A week thereafter Ismay received a letter offering him the command of a cavalry brigade in India but declined solidifying his choice to remain a staff officer 70 As Deputy Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence Ismay had broad responsibilities and was concerned with every aspect of planning and preparation for a war which seemed imminent 71 Ismay dealt extensively with a variety of matters and focussed much of his attention on the preparation of anti aircraft defences 72 and co ordination among the military services 73 As the crisis in Europe escalated however Hankey announced his intention to retire in June 1938 74 Hankey hoped that one person preferably Ismay would inherit all of the positions he had occupied including Secretary of the CID clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to the Cabinet but the Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain decided that the positions should be split and assigned to different people 75 In the end Ismay was named only to the position of Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence effective 1 August 1938 36 Ismay assumed the position scarcely more than a year before the outbreak of the Second World War and the war totally dominated his time in office Soon after Ismay took office Hitler initiated a crisis over the Sudetenland While Chamberlain was at the Munich Conference attempting to resolve the crisis Ismay ordered the digging of trenches in London as protection against air attacks should war occur 76 77 Ismay later said that he thought Britain should have gone to war at Munich instead of waiting but said nothing at the time 78 As it became increasingly clear that war was inevitable in 1939 Ismay also prepared for a smooth simple and practically instantaneous transition from the Committee of Imperial Defence to the War Cabinet or whatever other wartime authority the government might choose 79 With the outbreak of the Second World War the CID was immediately absorbed into the War Cabinet as Ismay had planned 80 In the midst of the turmoil Ismay was promoted to Major General 59 and began to work closely with Chamberlain accompanying him on a visit to France in December 1939 81 Ismay disagreed with several Allied strategic choices including the decision to try to stop the German advance in Belgium but kept his doubts to himself 82 In April 1940 Winston Churchill took control of the Military Co ordination Committee charged with overseeing all of the military services He selected Ismay as his chief staff officer which also gave Ismay the additional responsibility of serving on the Chiefs of Staff Committee 59 While serving under Churchill had been a life long dream for Ismay he was initially sceptical about the duties of his new position which seemed unclear and poorly defined 83 On 10 May after the beginning of the Battle of France Chamberlain resigned and Churchill became both Prime Minister and Minister of Defence 84 85 Ismay who later called Churchill the greatest War Prime Minister in our history was thrilled by this development and continued to act as Churchill s chief staff officer and military adviser 86 According to Churchill the two developed a close personal and official connection that was preserved unbroken and unweakened throughout the war 87 As part of this relationship not long after Churchill became Prime Minister he arranged for Ismay to be appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in June 1940 88 From the very moment he became Prime Minister Churchill relied heavily on General Pug Ismay who provided a crucial bridge to the military establishment 89 Ismay served as the principal assistant to Mr Churchill in his capacity as Minister of Defence continued to serve as the Secretary of the Imperial Defence Chiefs of Staff Committee 90 and became Deputy Secretary of the War Cabinet 91 Ismay was crucial to running the war effort as he was able to effectively link the military and civilian leadership Jock Colville Churchill s private secretary wrote that Ismay had the tact patience and skill in promoting compromise needed to keep the war running smoothly 1 Ismay had the additional advantage of being admired by the Service Chiefs for his long and distinguished record as a soldier 92 In his role Ismay handled nearly all military messages from Churchill to the Service Chiefs 93 Ismay also gave Churchill advice on military matters and often begged him to be reasonable 94 when he contemplated foolish actions believing that Churchill s greatest fault was his impetuous nature and impatience with opposition 78 When the Chiefs of Staff found Churchill s demands unfeasible Ismay took the role of converting the Prime Minister to their viewpoint 95 As Churchill s chief military adviser Ismay frequently attended wartime conferences and meetings of the Allies and accompanied other British leaders such as Foreign Minister Anthony Eden on their travels Ismay s travel to the conferences began in 1941 when he went with Lord Beaverbrook to the first Moscow Conference 90 Because English participation in the conference was a secret Ismay faked influenza to explain his absence from London while it was taking place 96 The Conference was also the first time that Ismay worked closely with the Americans whom he found quite congenial 97 Ismay would continue to work closely with the Americans throughout the remainder of the war and he accompanied Churchill on his 1942 trip to the United States 90 Shortly after their return US General Dwight D Eisenhower arrived in Britain to command the American forces He established close relations with Ismay who liked him greatly and assisted him in co ordinating with both British forces and the Cabinet 98 Eisenhower thought highly of Ismay remembering him for his stalwart support and noting He was one of those men whose great ability condemned him throughout the war to a staff position Consequently his name may be forgotten but the contributions he made to the winning of the war were equal to those of many whose names became household words 99 Not long after Eisenhower arrived on 16 August 1942 Ismay was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General 91 Around the same time his good relations with the Americans were recognised by others in the government Thus in November 1942 when Eleanor Roosevelt visited Britain Lady Ismay was chosen to host her for one night of her stay 100 In January 1943 Ismay accompanied Churchill to the Casablanca Conference 101 Ismay attended nearly all of the proceedings of the Conference and helped work towards consensus where the Americans and British disagreed on issues 102 Ismay was also appointed to the committee which wrote the formal report of the conference 103 After the conference Ismay visited the American headquarters in Algiers to meet with Eisenhower and helped resolve some differences of opinion between Eisenhower and his British colleagues 104 105 After Casablanca Ismay accompanied Churchill to the third Washington Conference in May 1943 106 At the conference Ismay first met the American Admiral William D Leahy who is often described as his American counterpart The two developed a friendly relationship and Leahy wrote in his memoirs General Sir Hastings Ismay became my favorite perhaps because his position closely paralleled my own 107 After the Washington Conference came the Quebec Conference in August 1943 Once again Ismay attended along with Churchill 108 The Quebec Conference was the first time that the Allied leaders discussed the full details of Operation Overlord so Ismay spent much of his time explaining details of the operation to Churchill and other leaders 109 During the conference Ismay also observed that Dudley Pound had had a breakdown He took the information to Churchill who demanded Pound s resignation a week later 110 Shortly after returning from Quebec Ismay participated in his next conference travelling with Anthony Eden to the Moscow Conference in October and November where he served as Eden s top military adviser 111 At the conference Ismay handled all of the Soviet questions about the planning for Operation Overlord 112 113 and met Joseph Stalin personally for the first time 114 After the conference Ismay wrote that he was optimistic about sic post war relations with Russia showing his belief that the meeting had gone well 115 Only four days after returning from the Moscow Conference Ismay left England again for the Cairo Conference and Teheran Conference with Churchill 116 One major source of conflict at the Cairo Conference was an American proposal to appoint an overall commander for the strategic bombing of Germany Ismay and the British were strongly opposed and Ismay wrote a long paper against the idea which became the basis of British policy on the subject 117 At Teheran Ismay helped to argue the case for Operation Overlord but immediately after the conference he developed bronchitis and returned to England by ship scrapping his other plans for the trip 118 In the first several months of 1944 Ismay spent almost all of his time planning for the Normandy Landings 119 As part of the planning Ismay personally coordinated the plans for Operation Bodyguard and Operation Fortitude which were designed to deceive the Germans about the planned Normandy landings 120 In March Duncan Sandys Churchill s son in law told Ismay that Basil Liddell Hart a noted strategist and historian had somehow discovered the secret plans for the Normandy landings This development had the potential to compromise the entire operation so Ismay personally interviewed Liddell Hart who claimed to have simply worked it all out for himself without any access to secret information 121 After their interview Ismay directed the matter to the MI5 who never found evidence of wrongdoing although it is suspected that Liddell Hart may in fact have received information from military planners 122 On 20 May 1944 less than a month before the Normandy Landings were scheduled to take place Ismay was promoted to the rank of full general 123 After the successful D Day landings King George VI decided to visit the troops in Normandy and selected Ismay to accompany him on the visit 124 In September Ismay accompanied Churchill to the Second Quebec Conference 125 Ismay also accompanied Churchill on his visits to Moscow and Paris in late 1944 126 In February 1945 Ismay attended the Yalta Conference He found the conference different from the previous ones where the military element had been the prima donna occupying the centre of the stage 127 Instead at Yalta political issues took precedence leaving Ismay and other military advisers waiting for calls that never came 127 128 On VE Day Ismay found it quite impossible to be completely happy about the future due to the lingering Japanese threat and the rising threat of the Soviet Union 129 Nonetheless he was happy to be one of only three men to hold the same high government position throughout the war in Europe along with Edward Bridges 1st Baron Bridges and the King 130 After VE Day Ismay accompanied Churchill to the Potsdam Conference Like Yalta the conference focussed primarily on political issues so there was little for Ismay to do 131 132 After Clement Attlee defeated Churchill in the 1945 election becoming Prime Minister Ismay kept his position working with Attlee at the conference but remained loyal to Churchill 133 Ismay and Churchill remained friends for the remainder of their lives and Ismay even helped Churchill write his memoirs reviewing and commenting on each chapter of his manuscript 134 Shortly after the Potsdam Conference the war in Asia ended on VJ Day After this victory Ismay would have liked to retire at once 135 but at Attlee s request he remained in the military for another year 135 Before continuing work however Ismay travelled to New York on 6 September for a six week vacation he received a warm welcome 136 Over the next year Ismay worked largely on the issue of reform for the Ministry of Defence From December 1945 to February 1946 Ismay worked with a small committee to draft the Statement Relating to Defence which formed the basis of reforms implemented by Attlee later that year 137 For his role Ismay became known as the chief architect of the post war Ministry of Defence 138 During the year following the war Ismay received many honours for his service In August 1945 as part of Churchill s resignation honours he was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour an honour rarely bestowed on soldiers 139 140 The next January he received the Legion of Merit from the United States 141 He was promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in June 142 Finally he was named the Chairman of the Council of the Royal National Institute for the Blind 143 In November 1946 Ismay announced his intention to retire 144 Attlee accepted his retirement effective on 31 December 1946 145 Immediately after retiring in the 1947 New Year Honours Ismay was created a baron 146 taking the title Baron Ismay of Wormington in the County of Gloucester 147 He accepted the barony and took his seat in the House of Lords in February 148 Shortly after Ismay s retirement Lord Mountbatten of Burma was appointed as the last British Viceroy of India and Ismay offered to serve as his chief of staff 149 150 Thus in March 1947 Ismay left with Mountbatten for India to help preside over its transition to independence 151 After arriving in India Ismay soon came to the conclusion that the situation there was dire heading for civil war and told Mountbatten that India was a ship on fire in mid ocean with ammunition in her hold 152 When Ismay and Mountbatten arrived they were committed to preserving a unified India but Ismay soon realised that the Moslem League would not agree to any plan which did not provide for the creation of Pakistan as an independent sovereign state 153 In April after several unsuccessful meetings with Muhammad Ali Jinnah Mountbatten came to the same conclusion and began drawing up plans for the partition 154 Over the next month Mountbatten finalised his partition plan and on 2 May 1947 he sent Ismay back to London to present it to the British government 155 Ismay presented the plan to the Prime Minister and Cabinet casting partition as a Hobson s choice 156 157 Ismay stayed in England for the next month and helped to alter the plan based on the cabinet s suggestions before returning to India on 31 May 158 Once the partition plan had been accepted Ismay worked on implementing the details In particular Ismay dealt with the issue of dividing the Indian Army Based on his own experiences and love of the Indian Army Ismay did his utmost to persuade the leaders of the new Indian and Pakistani states not to separate the army immediately His efforts failed due to the opposition of Jinnah 159 Ismay also travelled to Kashmir to ask Hari Singh to hold an immediate referendum over whether his territory would join India or Pakistan Once again Ismay was unsuccessful and Singh changed the subject each time that Ismay tried to discuss the referendum 160 Throughout the period immediately following independence Ismay also tried to ensure that stories printed in the Indian and Pakistani press about the partition were accurate but once again he was largely unsuccessful 161 The situation in India continued to deteriorate throughout the summer and autumn of 1947 Nevertheless Ismay and Mountbatten had agreed that Ismay would remain in his position for only three to four months after partition In December 1947 he left India to return to England 162 Shortly after his return Ismay served briefly on the British delegation to the United Nations to deal with the Kashmir issue Ismay played only a limited role as the Pakistanis suspected him of pro Indian sympathies 163 164 Shortly after Ismay returned from the United Nations Prime Minister Attlee asked him to become the Chairman of the Council of the Festival of Britain scheduled to take place in 1951 165 166 Ismay accepted the offer and on 10 March 1948 he officially took the position of chairman 167 The appointment was largely symbolic and Ismay was at least partly appointed to forestall potential criticism by his friend Winston Churchill The Council however wielded slight but not insignificant influence and Ismay took his duties seriously 168 Ismay helped to ensure that the festival would be truly national in character rather than just confined to London As such in June 1949 he called together all of the mayors in Britain to discuss the festival this was the first meeting of all British mayors since 1916 169 Ismay also publicly defended the large cost of the festival and emphasised its historic nature saying We are consciously and deliberately determined to make history 170 Once the festival opened Ismay hosted various notable guests including Margaret Truman the daughter of US President Harry Truman 171 In the 1951 general election held shortly after the conclusion of the Festival of Britain Churchill s Conservative Party once again won a majority in Parliament making Churchill Prime Minister for a second time The day after the election Churchill asked Ismay to become the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in his cabinet Ismay was overjoyed at the prospect of serving under Churchill again and accepted the post immediately 172 Although not a politician Ismay was well suited for the position because of his close relationships with the leaders of the commonwealth countries largely the result of his work during the war 173 As a result of his military background and experience Ismay became more closely involved in defence matters than is usual for a Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and often served as de facto Minister of Defence and serving as temporary Minister of Defence until the permanent appointee Harold Alexander was able to take office 172 174 Through his close involvement in defence matters Ismay began to be involved with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization In January 1952 he accompanied Churchill to a meeting in Ottawa about the alliance 175 and in February 1952 he attended the NATO Lisbon Conference as the British Ministry of Defence representative 176 When leaving the conference Ismay remarked to Alfred Gruenther this is the first that I have seen of NATO and thank heaven it s the last 177 At the Lisbon Conference the members of NATO agreed to appoint a Secretary General who would direct the organisation s staff and serve as Vice Chairman of the Atlantic Council The position was initially offered to Sir Oliver Franks but he declined 178 As such the allies scrambled to find someone else to take the position Two weeks later the countries agreed to ask Ismay to become Secretary General at the suggestion of Churchill and Anthony Eden 179 Eden asked Ismay to accept the position but his response was an immediate and emphatic negative as he saw NATO as an overly bureaucratic and inefficient organisation 180 and complained that the position of Secretary General was divided and ill defined 179 Churchill then personally asked Ismay to accept the position telling him that NATO provided the best if not the only hope of peace in our time 180 After further urging Ismay reluctantly agreed to take the job On 12 March 1952 the Atlantic Council officially passed a resolution appointing Ismay Secretary General 181 and he started work on 24 March 182 Ismay s appointment to the position was well received enjoying the unanimous support of all the NATO members The press and public also responded favourably The Times wrote of all the candidates whose names have been mentioned Lord Ismay would seem to have the strongest qualifications for the post 181 The New York Times applauded his vast experience in military planning strategy and administration 183 and The Washington Post wrote that Ismay would bring NATO great authority experience and energy and a personal charm that can dissolve difficulties 184 As the first Secretary General Ismay was assuming an entirely new role in the history of international organizations and as such he helped to define the position itself 185 While Ismay deemed it wise not to step too boldly in a political role in disputes among the members he asserted himself strongly on issues relevant to the organisation of NATO 186 From the very beginning of his time in office Ismay worked to empower the permanent representatives to NATO and emphasised that they had the same legal authority to make decisions as the NATO foreign ministers 186 Ismay was also a proponent of NATO expansion saying that NATO must grow until the whole free world gets under one umbrella 187 However before Warsaw Pact was even put in place he opposed the request to join NATO made by the USSR in 1954 188 189 saying that the Soviet request to join NATO is like an unrepentant burglar requesting to join the police force 190 thus making apparent that NATO alliance the police force was directed against the USSR As stated in the official NATO website the request tested the limits of NATO s willingness to admit new members 191 As Secretary General Ismay also worked to encourage closer political co ordination among the members of the alliance During the Suez Crisis he offered his good offices to help resolve issues among members of the alliance 192 Ismay also offered to help mediate disputes over Cyprus 186 In December 1956 Ismay decided to retire from NATO He told the press that he was not giving up his position for personal reasons but because he felt it needed a fresh hand and a fresh brain 193 Paul Henri Spaak was immediately chosen as his successor but Ismay remained in office until May 1957 when he left with the affection and respect of all the NATO members 193 While Secretary General Ismay is also credited as having been the first person to say that the purpose of the alliance was to keep the Russians out the Americans in and the Germans down a saying that has since become a common way to quickly describe the alliance 194 195 Immediately after leaving NATO Ismay was honoured by Queen Elizabeth II with an appointment to the Order of the Garter His youngest daughter Mary had married George Seymour equerry to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and their daughter Katharine is a god daughter of Princess Margaret 196 He was appointed to boards of several corporations including the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation 197 198 Ismay also began writing his memoirs The Memoirs of General Lord Ismay which were published in 1960 by Viking Press In his memoirs Ismay focussed principally on his Second World War service and as such one reviewer called them a most significant addition to the literature of the Second World War 199 In 1963 Ismay was asked to again assist in a review of the organisation of the British military along with Sir Ian Jacob 200 Although Ismay was ill throughout most of the review and did relatively little of the work his influence was strong and the final product of the review largely reflected his opinions 201 In the end the Ismay Jacob Report recommended strengthening the central power of the Ministry of Defence substantially and in 1964 Parliament implemented its recommendations 202 Ismay died on 17 December 1965 at his home Wormington Grange Gloucestershire at the age of 78 As he had no male heir his title became extinct 203
