The Second Fitna was a period of general political and military disorder and conflicts in the Islamic community during the early Umayyad caliphate note 1 It followed the death of the first Umayyad caliph Mu awiya I in 680 and lasted for about twelve years The war involved the suppression of two challenges to the Umayyad dynasty the first by Husayn ibn Ali as well as his supporters including Sulayman ibn Surad and Mukhtar al Thaqafi who rallied for his revenge in Iraq and the second by Abd Allah ibn al Zubayr The roots of the civil war go back to the First Fitna After the assassination of the third caliph Uthman the Islamic community experienced its first civil war over the question of leadership with the main contenders being Ali and Mu awiya Following the assassination of Ali in 661 and the abdication of his successor Hasan the same year Mu awiya became the sole ruler of the caliphate Mu awiya s unprecedented move to nominate his son Yazid as his heir sparked opposition and tensions soared after Mu awiya s death Husayn ibn Ali was invited by the pro Alids note 2 of Kufa to overthrow the Umayyads but was killed with his small company en route to Kufa at the Battle of Karbala in October 680 Yazid s army assaulted anti government rebels in Medina in August 683 and subsequently besieged Mecca where Ibn al Zubayr had established himself in opposition to Yazid After Yazid died in November the siege was abandoned and Umayyad authority collapsed throughout the caliphate except in certain parts of Syria most provinces recognized Ibn al Zubayr as caliph A series of pro Alid movements demanding revenge for Husayn s death emerged in Kufa beginning with Ibn Surad s Penitents movement which was crushed by the Umayyads at the Battle of Ayn al Warda in January 685 Kufa was then taken over by Mukhtar Though his forces routed a large Umayyad army at the Battle of Khazir in August 686 Mukhtar and his supporters were slain by the Zubayrids in April 687 following a series of battles Under the leadership of Abd al Malik ibn Marwan the Umayyads reasserted control over the caliphate after defeating the Zubayrids at the Battle of Maskin in Iraq and killing Ibn al Zubayr in the Siege of Mecca in 692 Abd al Malik made key reforms in the administrative structure of the caliphate including increasing caliphal power restructuring the army and Arabizing and Islamizing the bureaucracy The events of the Second Fitna intensified sectarian tendencies in Islam and various doctrines were developed within what would later become the Sunni and Shi a denominations of Islam After the third caliph Uthman s assassination by rebels in 656 the rebels and the townspeople of Medina declared Ali a cousin and son in law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad caliph Most of the Quraysh the grouping of Meccan clans to which Muhammad and all the three caliphs belonged led by Muhammad s prominent companions Talha ibn Ubayd Allah and Zubayr ibn al Awam and Muhammad s widow A isha refused to recognize Ali They called for revenge against Uthman s killers and the election of a new caliph through shura consultation These events precipitated the First Fitna Ali emerged victorious against these early opponents at the Battle of the Camel near Basra in November 656 thereupon moving his capital to the Iraqi garrison town of Kufa 4 Mu awiya the governor of Syria and a member of the Umayyad clan to which Uthman belonged also denounced Ali s legitimacy as caliph and the two confronted each other at the Battle of Siffin The battle ended in a stalemate in July 657 when Ali s forces refused to fight in response to Mu awiya s calls for arbitration Ali reluctantly agreed to talks but a faction of his forces later called the Kharijites broke away in protest condemning his acceptance of arbitration as blasphemous 5 Arbitration could not settle the dispute between Mu awiya and Ali The latter was assassinated by a Kharijite in January 661 after Ali s forces had killed most of the Kharijites at the Battle of Nahrawan 6 Ali s eldest son Hasan became caliph but Mu awiya challenged his authority and invaded Iraq In August Hasan abdicated the caliphate to Mu awiya in a peace treaty thus ending the First Fitna The capital was transferred to Damascus 7 The treaty brought a temporary peace but no framework of succession was established 8 9 As it had in the past the issue of succession could potentially lead to problems in the future 10 The orientalist Bernard Lewis writes The only precedents available to Mu ƒÅwiya from Islamic history were election and civil war The former was unworkable the latter had obvious drawbacks 9 Mu awiya wanted to settle the issue in his lifetime by designating his son Yazid as his successor 10 In 676 he announced his nomination of Yazid 11 With no precedence in Islamic history hereditary succession aroused opposition from different quarters and the nomination was considered the corruption of the caliphate into monarchy 12 Mu awiya summoned a shura in Damascus and persuaded representatives from various provinces by diplomacy and bribes 9 The sons of a few of Muhammad s prominent companions including Husayn ibn Ali Abd Allah ibn al Zubayr Abd Allah ibn Umar and Abd al Rahman ibn Abi Bakr all of whom by virtue of their descent could also lay claim to the caliphal office 13 14 opposed the nomination Mu awiya s threats and the general recognition of Yazid throughout the caliphate forced them into silence 15 Historian Fred Donner writes that contentions over the leadership of the Muslim community had not been settled in the First Fitna and resurfaced with the death of Mu awiya in April 680 8 Before his death Mu awiya cautioned Yazid that Husayn and Ibn al Zubayr might challenge his rule and instructed him to defeat them if they did Ibn al Zubayr in particular was considered dangerous and was to be treated harshly unless he came to terms 16 Upon his succession Yazid charged the governor of Medina his cousin Walid ibn Utba ibn Abi Sufyan to secure allegiance from Husayn Ibn al Zubayr and Ibn Umar with force if necessary Walid sought the advice of his kinsman Marwan ibn al Hakam He counseled that Ibn al Zubayr and Husayn should be forced to give allegiance as they were dangerous while Ibn Umar should be left alone since he posed no threat 17 18 Walid summoned the two but Ibn al Zubayr escaped to Mecca Husayn answered the summons but declined to give allegiance in the secretive environment of the meeting suggesting it should be done in public Marwan threatened to imprison him but due to Husayn s kinship with Muhammad Walid was unwilling to take any action against him A few days later Husayn left for Mecca without giving allegiance 19 In the view of the Islamicist G R Hawting tensions and pressures which had been suppressed by Mu awiya came to the surface during Yazid s caliphate and erupted after his death when Umayyad authority was temporarily eclipsed 14 Husayn had considerable support in Kufa The inhabitants of the town had fought the Umayyads and their Syrian allies during the First Fitna 20 They were dissatisfied with Hasan s abdication 21 and strongly resented Umayyad rule 22 After the death of Hasan in 669 they had attempted unsuccessfully to interest Husayn in revolting against Mu awiya 23 After the latter died the pro Alids of Kufa once again invited Husayn to lead them in revolt against Yazid To assess the situation the Mecca based Husayn sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil who gained widespread support in Kufa and suggested Husayn join his sympathizers there Yazid removed Nu man ibn Bashir al Ansari as governor due to his inaction over Ibn Aqil s activities and replaced him with Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad then governor of Basra On Yazid s instructions Ibn Ziyad suppressed the rebellion and executed Ibn Aqil 2 Encouraged by his cousin s letter and unaware of his execution Husayn left for Kufa To track him down Ibn Ziyad stationed troops along the routes leading to the city He was intercepted at Karbala a desert plain north of Kufa Some 4 000 troops arrived later to force his submission to Yazid After a few days of negotiations and his refusal to submit Husayn was killed along with some 70 of his male companions in the Battle of Karbala on 10 October 680 2 Following Husayn s death Yazid faced increased opposition to his rule from Abd Allah ibn al Zubayr a son of Muhammad s companion Zubayr ibn al Awam and a grandson of the first caliph Abu Bakr r 632 634 Ibn al Zubayr secretly began taking allegiance in Mecca 24 though publicly he only called for a shura to elect a new caliph 3 At first Yazid tried placating him by sending gifts and delegations in an attempt to reach a settlement 24 After Ibn al Zubayr s refusal to recognize him Yazid sent a force led by Ibn al Zubayr s estranged brother Amr to arrest him The force was defeated and Amr was executed 25 In addition to the growing influence of Ibn al Zubayr in Medina the city s inhabitants were disillusioned with Umayyad rule and Mu awiya s agricultural projects 3 which included confiscation of their lands to increase government revenue 12 Yazid invited the notables of Medina to Damascus and tried to win them over with gifts They were unpersuaded however and on their return to Medina narrated tales of Yazid s lavish lifestyle and practices considered by many to be impious including drinking wine hunting with hounds and his love for music The Medinese under the leadership of Abd Allah ibn Hanzala renounced their allegiance to Yazid and expelled the governor Yazid s cousin Uthman ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Sufyan and the Umayyads residing in the city Yazid dispatched a 12 000 strong army under the command of Muslim ibn Uqba to reconquer the Hejaz western Arabia After failed negotiations the Medinese were defeated in the Battle of al Harra and the city was plundered for three days Having forced the rebels to renew their allegiance Yazid s army headed for Mecca to subdue Ibn al Zubayr 26 27 Ibn Uqba died on the way and command passed to Husayn ibn Numayr who besieged Mecca in September 683 The siege lasted for several weeks during which the Ka aba caught fire Yazid s sudden death in November 683 ended the campaign After trying unsuccessfully to persuade Ibn al Zubayr to accompany him to Syria and be declared caliph there Ibn Numayr left with his troops 28 With the demise of Yazid and the withdrawal of Syrian troops Ibn al Zubayr was now de facto ruler of the Hejaz and the rest of Arabia note 3 and he openly declared himself caliph Soon afterwards he was recognized in Egypt as well as in Iraq where the Umayyad governor Ibn Ziyad had been expelled by the tribal nobility ashraf 30 Coins bearing Ibn al Zubayr s name were minted in parts of southern Persia Fars and Kirman 28 31 After Yazid s death his son and nominated successor Mu awiya II became caliph but his authority was limited to certain parts of Syria 32 Mu awiya II died after a few months with no suitable Sufyanid Umayyads of the line of Mu awiya descendants of Abu Sufyan candidate to succeed him The northern Syrian Qays tribes supported Ibn al Zubayr 33 as did the governors of the Syrian districts of Hims Qinnasrin and Palestine while the Damascus governor Dahhak ibn Qays was also leaning toward Ibn al Zubayr Moreover many Umayyads including Marwan ibn al Hakam the most senior among them at the time were willing to recognize him Pro Umayyad tribes particularly the Banu Kalb dominated the district of Jordan and had support in Damascus They were determined to install an Umayyad 34 The Kalbite chief Ibn Bahdal was related in marriage to the Sufyanid caliphs and his tribe had held a privileged position under them note 4 He wanted to see Yazid s younger son Khalid on the throne 36 Ibn Ziyad convinced Marwan to put forward his own candidacy as Khalid was considered too young for the post by the non Kalbites in the pro Umayyad coalition 37 Marwan was acknowledged as caliph in a shura of pro Umayyad tribes summoned to the Kalbite stronghold of Jabiya in June 684 33 Pro Zubayrid tribes refused to recognize Marwan and the two sides clashed at the Battle of Marj Rahit in August 684 The pro Zubayrid Qays under Dahhak s leadership were slaughtered and many of their senior leaders were slain 36 Marwan s accession was a turning point as Syria was reunited under the Umayyads and the Umayyads focus was turned to regaining lost territories 38 Marwan and his son Abd al Aziz expelled the Zubayrid governor of Egypt with the help of local tribes 38 The Zubayrid attack on Palestine led by Mus ab was repulsed 39 but an Umayyad campaign to retake the Hejaz was defeated near Medina 40 Marwan dispatched Ibn Ziyad to restore Umayyad control in Iraq 39 After Marwan died in April 685 he was succeeded by his son Abd al Malik 38 About the time of caliph Yazid s death the Umayyad governor of Sijistan present day eastern Iran Yazid ibn Ziyad faced a rebellion of the Zunbil in the eastern dependency of Zabulistan who captured Ibn Ziyad s brother Abu Ubayda Yazid ibn Ziyad attacked the Zunbil but was defeated and killed His brother Salm the Umayyad governor of Khurasan which comprised present day northern Iran as well as parts of Central Asia and present day Afghanistan sent Talha ibn Abd Allah al Khuza i as the new governor of Sijistan Talha ransomed Abu Ubayda but died shortly afterwards 41 42 The weakening of central authority resulted in the outbreak of tribal factionalism and rivalries that the Arab emigrants of the Muslim armies had brought with them in the conquered lands Talha s successor who was from Rabi a tribe was soon driven out by the Rabi a s tribal opponents from the Mudar Tribal feuds consequently ensued which continued at least until the arrival of the Zubayrid governor Abd al Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Amir at the end of 685 He put an end to the inter tribal fighting and defeated the Zunbil rebellion 41 42 In Khurasan Salm kept the news of caliph Yazid s death secret for some time When it became known he obtained from his troops temporary allegiance to himself but was soon after expelled by them On his departure in the summer of 684 he appointed Abd Allah ibn Khazim al Sulami a Mudarite as governor of Khurasan Ibn Khazim recognized Ibn al Zubayr but was overwhelmed by the Rabi a Mudar feuds The Rabi a opposed Zubayrid rule due to their hatred of the Mudarite Ibn Khazim who ultimately suppressed them but soon after faced rebellion from his erstwhile allies from the Banu Tamim 43 44 The inter tribal warfare over control of Khurasan continued for several years and Ibn Khazim was killed in 691 45 Ibn al Zubayr s authority in these areas had been nominal particularly in Khurasan where Ibn Khazim ruled with virtual independence 46 During his revolt Ibn al Zubayr had allied with the Kharijites who opposed the Umayyads and the Alids After claiming the caliphate he denounced their religious views and refused to accept their form of governance which led to the breakup of their alliance 47 A group of Kharijites went to Basra the rest to central Arabia and began destabilizing his rule 48 49 note 5 Until then he had been supported by the pro Alid Kufan nobleman Mukhtar al Thaqafi in his opposition to Yazid Ibn al Zubayr denied him a prominent official position which they had agreed upon earlier In April 684 Mukhtar deserted him and went on to incite pro Alid sentiment in Kufa 53 A few prominent Alid supporters in Kufa seeking to atone for their failure to assist Husayn which they considered a sin launched a movement under Sulayman ibn Surad a companion of Muhammad and an ally of Ali to fight the Umayyads Calling themselves the Tawwabin Penitents they remained underground while the Umayyads controlled Iraq After caliph Yazid s death and the subsequent ouster of Ibn Ziyad the Tawwabin openly called for avenging Husayn s slaying 54 Although they attracted large scale support in Kufa 55 they lacked a political program their chief objective being to punish the Umayyads or sacrifice themselves in the process 56 When Mukhtar returned to Kufa he attempted to dissuade the Tawwabin from their endeavor in favor of an organized movement to gain control of the city Ibn Surad s stature prevented his followers from accepting Mukhtar s proposal 57 Out of the 16 000 men who enlisted 4 000 mobilized for the fight In November 684 the Tawwabin left to confront the Umayyads after mourning for a day at Husayn s grave in Karbala The two armies met in January 685 at the Battle of Ayn al Warda in the Jazira Upper Mesopotamia The battle lasted for three days during which most of the Tawwabin including Ibn Surad were killed while a few escaped to Kufa 58 Since his return to Kufa Mukhtar had been calling for revenge against Husayn s killers and the establishment of an Alid caliphate in the name of Ali s son Muhammad ibn al Hanafiyya while declaring himself his representative 59 The defeat of the Tawwabin left him as the leader of the Kufan pro Alids In October 685 Mukhtar and his supporters a significant number of whom consisted of local non Arab converts mawali overthrew Ibn al Zubayr s governor and seized control of Kufa His control extended to most of Iraq and parts of north western Iran 60 His preferential treatment of the mawali note 6 whom he awarded equal status with the Arabs resulted in rebellion of the Arab tribal nobility After crushing the rebellion Mukhtar executed Kufans involved in the killing of Husayn including Umar ibn Sa ad the commander of the army that had killed Husayn As a result of these measures thousands of Kufan ashraf fled to Basra 62 He then sent his general Ibrahim ibn al Ashtar to confront an approaching Umayyad army led by Ibn Ziyad which had been sent to reconquer the province The Umayyad army was routed at the Battle of Khazir in August 686 and Ibn Ziyad was killed 63 In Basra Muhammad ibn al Ash ath Shabath ibn Rib i and other Kufan refugees who were anxious to return to their city and regain their lost privileges persuaded its governor Mus ab ibn al Zubayr the younger brother of Abd Allah ibn al Zubayr to attack Kufa 64 Mukhtar sent his army to confront Mus ab but it was defeated in the first battle at Madhar located on the Tigris between Basra and Kufa Mukhtar s army retreated to Harura a village near Kufa but was annihilated by Mus ab s forces in the second battle there Mukhtar and his remaining supporters took refuge in Kufa s palace where they were besieged by Mus ab Four months later in April 687 Mukhtar was killed while attempting a sortie Some 6 000 of his supporters surrendered whom Mus ab executed under pressure from Ibn al Ash ath s son Abd al Rahman and other ashraf 65 Mukhtar s fall left the Umayyads and the Zubayrids as the remaining belligerents in the war 66 Following Marwan s accession in June 684 Ibn Ziyad had been sent to reconquer Iraq It was then he defeated the Tawwabin at Ayn al Warda After their disastrous defeat at Marj Rahit the Qays had regrouped in the Jazira and had hampered Ibn Ziyad s efforts to reconquer the province for a year They continued supporting the Zubayrids 39 Unable to defeat them in their fortified positions Ibn Ziyad moved on to capture Mosul from Mukhtar s governor Mukhtar sent a small army of 3 000 cavalrymen to retake the city Despite its victory in the battle July 686 the force retreated due to the Syrians numerical superiority 67 A month later Ibn Ziyad was killed by Mukhtar s reinforced army at the Battle of Khazir 68 With Ibn Ziyad dead Abd al Malik abandoned his plans to reconquer Iraq for several years and focused on consolidating Syria 69 where his rule was threatened by internal disturbances and renewed hostilities with the Byzantines 70 Nonetheless he led two abortive campaigns in Iraq 689 and 690 71 and instigated a failed anti Zubayrid revolt in Basra through his agents Abd al Malik s Basran supporters were severely repressed by Mus ab in retaliation 72 After entering a truce with the Byzantines and overcoming internal dissent Abd al Malik returned his attention to Iraq 70 In 691 he besieged the Qaysite stronghold of Qarqisiya in the Jazira After failing to overpower them he won over the Qays with concessions and promises of amnesty 52 73 Reinforcing his troops with these formerly Zubayrid allies he moved to defeat Mus ab 70 whose position in Iraq had been weakened by a number of factors The Kharijites had resumed their raids in Arabia Iraq and Persia following the collapse of central authority as a result of the civil war In eastern Iraq and Persia a Kharijite faction the Azariqa had captured Fars and Kirman from the Zubayrids in 685 29 and continued raiding his domains 52 The people of Kufa and Basra had also turned against him because of his massacres and repression of Mukhtar and Abd al Malik s sympathizers 74 As a result Abd al Malik was able to secure the defections of many Zubayrid loyalists With a significant number of his forces and his most experienced commander Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra away to guard Basra from the Kharijites Mus ab was unable to effectively counter Abd al Malik He was defeated and killed at the Battle of Maskin in October 691 70 74 Having secured Iraq and consequently most of its dependencies note 7 Abd al Malik sent his general Hajjaj ibn Yusuf against Abd Allah ibn al Zubayr who had been cornered in the Hejaz by another Kharijite faction led by Najda 52 Najda had established an independent state in Najd and Yamamah in 685 29 captured Yemen and Hadhramawt in 688 and occupied Ta if in 689 49 Instead of heading directly to Mecca Hajjaj established himself in Ta if and bested the Zubayrids in several skirmishes In the meantime Syrian forces captured Medina from its Zubayrid governor later marching to aid Hajjaj who besieged Mecca in March 692 The siege lasted for six to seven months the bulk of Ibn al Zubayr s forces surrendered and he was killed fighting alongside his remaining partisans in October November 692 76 77 With his death the Hejaz came under Umayyad control marking the end of the civil war 78 Soon afterwards the Najda Kharijites were defeated by Hajjaj The Azariqa and other Kharijite factions remained active in Iraq until their suppression in 696 699 79 With the victory of Abd al Malik Umayyad authority was restored and hereditary rule in the caliphate was solidified Abd al Malik and his descendants in two cases his nephews ruled for another fifty eight years before being overthrown by the Abbasid Revolution in 750 80 After winning the war Abd al Malik enacted significant administrative changes in the caliphate Mu awiya had ruled through personal connections with individuals loyal to him and did not rely on his relatives 81 Although he had developed a highly trained army of Syrians it was only deployed in raids against the Byzantines Domestically he relied upon his diplomatic skills to enforce his will 82 The ashraf rather than government officials were the intermediaries between the provincial governors and the public 83 The military units in the provinces were derived from local tribes whose command also fell to the ashraf 83 Provinces retained much of the tax revenue and forwarded a small portion to the caliph 82 84 The former administrative system of the conquered lands was left intact Officials who had served under the Sasanian Persians or the Byzantines retained their positions The native languages of the provinces continued to be used officially and Byzantine and Sasanian coinage was used in the formerly Byzantine and Sasanian territories 85 The defection of the ashraf like Dahhak and Ibn Khazim and various Iraqi nobles to Ibn al Zubayr during the civil war convinced Abd al Malik that Mu awiya s decentralized system was difficult to maintain He thus set out to centralize his power 80 A professional army was developed in Syria and was used to impose government authority in the provinces 86 Moreover key government positions were awarded to close relatives of the caliph Abd al Malik required the governors to forward the provincial surplus to the capital 87 In addition Arabic was made the official language of the bureaucracy and a single Islamic currency replaced Byzantine and Sasanian coinage 88 giving the Umayyad administration an increasingly Muslim character 79 He terminated the permanent pensions of the participants in the early conquests and established a fixed salary for active servicemen 89 Abd al Malik s model was adopted by many Muslim governments that followed 80 It was during this period that the longstanding Qays Kalb split between the Arab tribes of Syria and the Jazira developed following the Battle of Marj Rahit It was paralleled in the division and rivalry between the Mudar led by the Banu Tamim and the Azd Rabi a alliance in Iraq and the eastern provinces Together these rivalries caused a realignment of tribal loyalties into two tribal confederations or super groups across the caliphate the North Arab or Qays Mudar bloc opposed by the South Arabs or Yemenis These terms were political rather than strictly geographical since the properly northern Rabi a adhered to the southern Yemenis 90 91 The Umayyad caliphs tried to maintain a balance between the two groups but their implacable rivalry became a fixture of the Arab world over the following decades Even originally unaligned tribes were drawn to affiliate themselves with one of the two super groups Their constant struggle for power and influence dominated the politics of the Umayyad caliphate creating instability in the provinces helping to foment the Third Fitna and contributing to the Umayyads final fall at the hands of the Abbasids 92 The division persisted long after the Umayyads fall the historian Hugh Kennedy writes As late as the nineteenth century battles were still being fought in Palestine between groups calling themselves Qays and Yaman 93 The death of Husayn produced widespread outcry and helped crystallize opposition to Yazid into an anti Umayyad movement based on Alid aspirations 94 The Battle of Karbala contributed to the definitive break between what later became the Shi a and Sunni denominations of Islam 95 96 This event catalyzed the transformation of Shi ism which hitherto had been a political stance 3 into a religious phenomenon 95 To this day it is commemorated each year by Shi a Muslims on the Day of Ashura 97 This period also saw the end of purely Arab Shi ism in the revolt of Mukhtar al Thaqafi 98 who mobilized the marginalized and socioeconomically exploited mawali by redressing their grievances Before then non Arab Muslims had not played any significant political role 99 100 101 Despite its immediate political failure Mukhtar s movement was survived by the Kaysanites a radical Shi a sect who introduced novel theological and eschatological concepts that influenced the later development of Shi ism 102 The Abbasids exploited the underground network of Kaysanite propagandists during their revolution 103 and the most numerous among their supporters were Shi a and non Arabs 104 The Second Fitna also gave rise to the idea of the Islamic Messiah the Mahdi 105 Mukhtar applied the title of Mahdi to Ali s son Muhammad ibn al Hanafiyya 105 Although the title had previously been applied to Muhammad Ali Husayn and others as an honorific Mukhtar employed the term in a messianic sense a divinely guided ruler who would redeem Islam 106 107 Ibn al Zubayr s rebellion was seen by many as an attempt to return to the pristine values of the early Islamic community His revolt was welcomed by a number of parties that were unhappy with Umayyad rule 47 108 To them the defeat of Ibn al Zubayr meant that all hope of restoring the old ideals of Islamic governance was lost 108 In this atmosphere according to historians Wilferd Madelung and Sa√Ød Amir Arjomand Ibn al Zubayr s role as the anti caliph shaped the later development of the concept of the Mahdi Some aspects of his career were already formulated into hadiths ascribed to Muhammad during Ibn al Zubayr s lifetime quarrels over the caliphate after the death of a caliph Mu awiya I escape of the Mahdi from Medina to Mecca taking refuge in the Ka aba defeat of an army sent against him by a person whose maternal tribe is Banu Kalb Yazid I Mahdi s recognition by the righteous people of Syria and Iraq 109 which then became characteristics of the Mahdi who was to appear in the future to restore the old glory of the Islamic community 106 110 111 This idea subsequently developed into an established doctrine in Islam 112
