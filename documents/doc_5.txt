Bramshill House in Bramshill northeast Hampshire England is one of the largest and most important Jacobean prodigy house mansions in England It was built in the early 17th century by the 11th Baron Zouche of Harringworth but was partly destroyed by fire a few years later The design shows the influence of the Italian Renaissance which became popular in England during the late 16th century The house was designated a Grade I listed building in 1952 The mansion s southern façade is notable for its decorative architecture which includes at its centre a large oriel window above the principal entrance Interior features include a great hall displaying 92 coats of arms on a Jacobean screen an ornate drawing room and a 126 5 foot long 38 6 m gallery Numerous columns and friezes are found throughout the mansion while several rooms have large tapestries depicting historical figures and events on their panelled walls The house is set in 262 acres 106 ha of grounds containing an 18 acre 7 3 ha lake The grounds which received a Grade II listing in 1984 are part of a Registered Historic Park that includes about 25 acres 10 ha of early 17th century formal gardens near the house The wider medieval park was landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century and contains woodland Bramshill appears to have been a local sporting and social venue since the 16th century The cricket ground at the house played host to a first class match in 1823 when an early Hampshire team played an England XI and it hosted three other matches in 1825 26 During the Second World War the mansion was used as a Red Cross maternity home before becoming the residence of the exiled King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania for a number of years It became the location of the Police Staff College in 1960 and was later home to the European Police College As a result many campus buildings have been added to the estate Owing to escalating maintenance costs the property was sold to the heritage property developers City Country in August 2014 Among the 14 ghosts reputed to haunt the house is that of a bride who accidentally locked herself in a chest on her wedding night and was not found until 50 years later Bramshill House is at the approximate centre of a triangle formed by Reading Basingstoke and Farnborough about 47 miles 76 km by road southwest of central London 1 2 It lies to the northeast of Hartley Wintney east of Hazeley off the B3349 road southeast of the village of Bramshill which lies on the B3011 road Three main lanes approach the property Mansion Drive from the B3011 in the southwest Reading Drive South from the B3011 to the east of Bramshill village from the north and the shorter Pheasantry Drive which approaches it from the southeast from Chalwin s Copse just north of the course of the River Hart Within the grounds is a private lane Lower Pool Road which connects Mansion Drive to Reading Drive South passing the pond and several outer buildings The latitudinal and longitudinal location is 51 19 57 9 N 0 54 43 2 W or also 51 332759 0 911991 2 The 1086 Domesday Book lists one of the two manors of Bromeselle the Anglo Norman spelling of Bromshyll as held by Hugh de Port 3 In the early 14th century Sir John Foxley c 1270 c 1325 Baron of the Exchequer 4 built and endowed a chapel in the village of Bramshill 5 His first wife Constance de Bramshill may have been the heiress of the Bramshill family Their son Thomas Foxley c 1305 1360 became MP for Berkshire in 1325 and was appointed constable of Windsor Castle in 1328 soon after the accession of the 14 year old Edward III 6 In 1347 he obtained a licence to build a manor house or small castle at Bramshill which included a 2 500 acre 1 000 ha wooded park 7 The house built between 1351 and 1360 had thick walls vaulted cellars and an internal courtyard measuring 100 by 80 feet 30 by 24 m 6 Based on the similarity of the surviving vaults under Bramshill House and those under what became the servants hall and steward s room at Windsor Castle it may have been a copy of William of Wykeham s work there 8 9 The estate remained in the hands of the Foxley family and their heirs the Essex family 10 until 1499 when it was sold to Giles Daubeney 1st Baron Daubeney Giles s son Henry Daubeney later Earl of Bridgewater sold the property to Henry VIII and in 1547 Edward VI granted the estate to William Paulet whose heirs sold it in 1600 to Sir Stephen Thornhurst of Agnes Court Kent 11 In March 1605 12 Edward la Zouche 11th Baron Zouche a favourite of James I 13 bought the property from Thornhurst A house was earlier planned on the site for Henry Frederick Prince of Wales 1594 1612 13 whose heraldic feathers are displayed above the central pediment 14 Lord Zouche demolished a large part of the building and began to build the Bramshill House of today Henry Shaw describes the new house which Zouche built as a specimen of Elizabethan sic architecture which merits particular attention exhibiting all the stateliness for which the period referred to was remarkable with a suite of apartments both large and lofty The amplitude of its dimensions indicate a princely residence 15 An inventory taken in 1634 after Zouche s death listed the library as having 250 books and a collection of mathematical instruments and revealed that the maids chamber was of a very high standard 16 James Zouch grandson of Edward la Zouche sold the property to the Earl of Antrim in 1637 at which time the house s furniture was valued at 2 762 17 During the reign of Charles I the house was partly destroyed by a fire On 25 June 1640 Lord Antrim sold Bramshill for 9 500 to Sir Robert Henley 18 In 1673 it was the property of his son Sir Andrew Henley 1st Baronet 19 Sir John Cope purchased the property in 1699 and his descendants occupied the premises until 1935 The Cope family shortened the wings on the south side in 1703 converted most of the chapel to a drawing room and introduced a mezzanine on the west side during the 18th century They were responsible for much of the interior with significant renovation work done in the 19th century and in 1920 20 After his victory over Napoleon the Duke of Wellington was offered his choice of house by Parliament he visited Bramshill but in 1817 chose Stratfield Saye instead 21 Numerous paintings and prints depict games and social events taking place on the lawn one such painting by Joseph Nash now in the National Fencing Museum depicts 17th century rapier practice with a number of upper class men women and children as spectators 22 The cricket ground at the house first played host to a first class match in 1823 when an early Hampshire team played an England XI Hampshire won by five wickets 23 Two further first class matches were played there in 1825 when Hampshire drew against Godalming and defeated Sussex 24 A final first class match was held there in 1826 when a combined Hampshire and Surrey team played and lost to Sussex 25 In 1935 the house was purchased from the Cope family by Ronald Nall Cain 2nd Baron Brocket the house s last private owner 26 It was used by the Red Cross as a maternity home during the Second World War after which it became the home of the exiled King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania for several years 27 Bramshill House became a Grade I listed building on 8 July 1952 28 29 and was acquired by the British government the following year 30 as a dedicated site for police training 31 It became the location of the National Police College in 1960 32 From 2005 two buildings on the site housed the European Police College CEPOL until this was moved to Budapest in 2014 33 34 By the late 1980s the estate had become expensive to maintain and according to John Wheeler Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee by 1989 it was in a poor state of repair 35 In July 2013 the Home Office placed the house and estate on the market for 25 million It was sold to the heritage property developers City Country in August 2014 36 In 2018 the house with a reduced estate of about 90 acres was put back on the market with a guide price of 10 million 37 38 The 15 bedroom 56 974 square feet 5 293 1 m2 Bramshill House is one of the largest and most important Jacobean mansions in England 21 39 described as one of the glories of English architecture by the historians Anthony Blunt and James Lees Milne 40 The architecture of the three storey building was inspired by the Italian Renaissance and was executed mainly by German builders 41 It is approximately 140 feet 43 m in length 19 The design is traditionally attributed to the architect John Thorpe although no records remain to confirm the attribution 42 The building stands on the edge of a plateau overlooking the park to the south 43 The plan of the house is unusual partly because of its incorporation of the earlier building it extends at right angles to the primary southern façade 42 The elevations are symmetrical facing outwards but the interior court is narrow and projecting wings lie at either end of the eastern and western sides 28 Bramshill House is three storeys high on the southern main entrance side and two storeys high to the north and east There are three vaulted cellars to the west 28 The house is built of red brick laid in English bond dressed with stone with ashlar quoining at the corners of the wings Stone dressings are featured on numerous large mullion windows An open carved parapet surmounts the building 19 The roof consists of red tiles and there are large gables on the west side 42 The chimney stacks are rectangular 28 The north façade has three bays separated by windows and features a loggia typical of early 17th century houses with a central arched entrance to accommodate coaches 42 The central bay is crowned by an ornamental pierced parapet below a niched Dutch gable which shelters a small statue of Lord Zouche 42 44 or James I 45 There are small obelisks at either side of the gable 28 Thorpe originally intended the main entrance of the house to be on this side building on the gatehouse of the earlier Foxley house 46 The southern façade was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as among the most fanciful pieces of Jacobean design in England 39 It is three storeys high and features three sets of three bays in either wing with five inner sections 47 The outer two of the inner sections feature eight angular windows aligned in rows of four on the first two floors and then a row of four windows on the top floor The inner two sections have the same layout on the first and top floors with eight windows aligned in rows of four on the first floor and four windows on the top floor but the ground floor features two arches which form part of the central loggia 47 The stone central bay 20 feet 6 1 m wide is emphasised by superimposed double decorated pilasters on all floors and the central archway of the loggia in the Doric Ionic and Corinthian orders 48 surmounted by a florid perforated pediment In addition there is an oriel window on the first floor above the main entrance 39 45 An important difference from the other sides of this building is a terrace 25 feet 7 6 m in width between the projecting wings a kind of architectural foreground to the garden 45 The terrace is bounded by a 3 foot 3 inch high 0 99 m balustrade 49 The arcade on the terrace of the southern front is a good example of Italian domestic architecture used in villas 50 The triglyphs and ornamented metopes together with the simple capitals of the columns indicate the Doric order but are light enough to be Ionic 51 The south entrance was the model for Darlington 37 the Crocker McMillin Mansion in New Jersey US built between 1901 and 1907 The east façade is the longest about 124 feet 38 m wide and two storeys high 45 It features four full height angular bays with two windows between while its upper walls have two arches set within a rectangular panel 28 On this side there is a Troco Terrace with a lawn as well as two arcaded openings at the side on either wing of the house The southernmost arcaded opening contains a bench with eight arches and has three tables one of which is older and octagonal 52 Carved in the wall at the side is a frieze consisting of four squares each depicting an animal a lion an elephant a wild boar and a camel 53 The west façade dates to the 18th century and is the only one with multiple gables 42 the windows on the ground floor are sashed 28 Two of the rooms have large tapestries on their walls depicting historical figures and scenes 54 Those in the drawing room contain scenes from Roman history and were based on designs by Peter Paul Rubens who supervised the work in Brussels These tapestries were initially made for Dudley Carleton 1st Viscount Dorchester Zouche s brother diplomat but in the end he rejected them for another set how the first set came to Bramshill is not known Rubens s sketches for the first and last tapestries in the series are in Alte Pinakothek Munich 55 The west section of the ground floor contains the former dining room and kitchen The openings in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope uncovering an original doorway with a four centred pointed arch 56 Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted 57 The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance on the north side of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas 58 The Great Hall to which an arcaded porch gives direct access retains the basic design of the original construction 59 It has a dais 59 and a Jacobean stone screen 13 feet 4 0 m high decorated with 92 shields Resident families emblazoned the shields with the arms of ancestors and family members 42 60 61 The entablature of the screen has a double row of 40 sculptured shields and has a depth of 2 feet 6 inches 0 76 m 51 Beyond the dais double doors lead into the Terrace Hall at the foot of the staircase 56 Across from this is the former dining room containing a large tapestry believed to have been made by an English artist representing forest scenery in very subdued colours 56 During the time of the Cope family in the 1880s the kitchen near the south hall was used as a dairy The kitchen and the adjoining room had back to back fireplaces 62 The drawing room containing four bay windows of different sizes is panelled with oak for its entire height of about 16 feet 4 9 m 63 One of the upper panels surmounted by its Corinthian entablature is a frieze depicting a fig grape and pomegranate each with foliage and blossoms One of the lower panels part of the dado in the same room has a section of projecting mouldings The upper panel is 2 feet 10 inches by 2 feet 4 inches 86 m 71 m the lower 2 feet 7 inches by 2 feet 6 inches 79 m 76 m 63 The massive chimneypiece in the drawing room is classically designed believed to be inspired by one of the great Italian architects of 16th century Mannerism Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola 64 It is two storeys in height the lower being Doric and the upper Ionic The distribution of the members is regular and the shafts of the columns are variegated marble The upper compartment of the chimneypiece is composed of separate pieces of the same diversified material and the frieze of the upper order also consists of coloured marble in the centre The fireplace is 6 feet 1 8 m wide and 4 feet 8 inches 1 42 m high and retains the ancient andirons used for burning wood These are large and well adorned particularly in the lower part 64 The ceilings of the drawing room and library are the most elaborate in the house 64 The plaster frieze in the library also displays fine workmanship 1 foot 7 inches 0 48 m wide it is designed in a striking arabesque pattern with an evident Florentine influence 63 In the 1880s the library had a collection of 5 000 volumes about half the number the Cope family owned at the time 65 The standards and balusters of the stairs on the north side of the hall came from Eversley Manor House and probably date to the mid 17th century 42 although the treads are original to the house and possibly mid 16th century 59 66 The walls above the stairs and on the first floor landing contain some very large paintings including several portraits 67 Beyond the staircase are the state rooms 67 and what was known as the Wrought Room 57 The room has an ornamental ceiling with a Renaissance chimneypiece 57 Two of the bedrooms the two White Rooms were originally connected to what was called the Flower de luce Room but the doors have been boarded up 68 The Long Gallery fills the first floor of the northern range 126 5 feet 38 6 m long and with a richly decorated stucco ceiling and a complex wooden chimneypiece 69 it formerly contained a very curious collection of portraits of distinguished characters 15 70 Also on the first floor is the Chapel Drawing Room in the south wing connected to the Drawing Room 71 The Copes created this room by reducing the size of the original chapel which is entered through it 72 The current chapel has an altar reredos with paintings of the Virgin Mary St Stephen St Mary Magdalene and St John the Evangelist by Alexander Rowan and dated by Pevsner to about 1840 69 73 The tapestry in the chapel room is older than the house and was assessed by an expert as dating to 1450 or earlier in the early 19th century it had hung in the Red Drawing Room 74 When the chapel ceiling was restored by Sir William Cope it was discovered that one section of the plaster work had previously been replaced with carved wood 74 The large window in the south wall of the courtyard was presumably moved from the original chapel 69 The house is set in 262 acres 106 ha of grounds 75 which include an 18 acre 7 3 ha lake north of the house 76 The grounds form part of a Registered Historic Park that received a Grade II listing in 1984 this was subsequently upgraded to Grade I in September 2017 Under this designation are the 25 acres 10 ha of early 17th century formal gardens near the house the wider 490 acre 200 ha medieval park landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century with 250 acres 100 ha of woodland 77 and buildings including an icehouse and a folly known as Conduit House 75 Parts of the park have been used for commercial softwood production since the 19th century 77 To the west of the house is Peatmoor Copse and to the east Bramshill Forest 2 and the grounds contained what was known as the Green Court and the Flower Garden at the time of William Henry Cope in the 1880s The Grade I listed gatehouse dates to the time of the Foxleys 78 The fir trees in the grounds are reputed to have been planted as a memento of his former home by James I who brought them from Scotland 70 79 The formal gardens were first laid out by Edward la Zouche a horticulturist Sir John Cope redesigned the gardens and continued the planting of trees in the park At the close of the 18th century the grounds were re landscaped to be less formal and some areas in the south were returned to parkland 9 Bramshill Park was conceived as a hunting box for Henry Frederick and became a popular estate for hunting 70 On 24 July 1621 while hunting in the park George Abbot Archbishop of Canterbury accidentally shot and killed one of the gamekeepers with his crossbow 12 An inquiry cleared him of murder 63 Another notable clergyman hunter who frequented Bramshill was Charles Kingsley rector of Eversley 80 who hunted fox and deer and collected butterflies there 81 and frequently took his family and friends 82 Kingsley was reportedly especially enamoured of the fir trees which he considered a source of constant delight 79 fondly naming them James the First s gnarled giants 83 In the 19th century Sir John Cope a friend of Kingsley s was known as a supporter of the fox hunt and especially as a breeder of fox hounds 84 85 The opening of the season at Bramshill in the late 1840s was noted in the British hunting press 86 The main avenue approaches from the southwest through an arched gateway formed by two Grade II listed early 19th century lodges 87 before crossing the Broad Water formed by the River Hart by a Grade I listed early 19th century bridge with two arches 88 There are separate listings for other structures near the house including the Grade I listed early 17th century triple arched gateway on the route to Reading to the northeast of the house 89 Grade I listed early 17th century boundary walls and turrets to the south and west 90 Grade II listed boundary walls and gate piers to the west including the kitchen garden 91 Grade I listed garden walls and gateways to the north and east 92 and the Grade II listed late 18th century stable block to the north 93 Bramshill has been cited as one of the most haunted houses in England 94 95 According to one UK police officer who worked at the college 14 ghosts have purportedly been identified although another officer at the college did not take these suggestions seriously 27 They include a Grey Lady one story suggests that her husband a religious dissenter was beheaded in the 17th century and a Green Man a Cope family member who either drowned in the lake in 1806 according to the journalist P Lal or threw himself off a cliff near Brighton according to the author Penny Legg 27 96 The Green Man dressed as his name suggests reportedly manifests near the lake as does the ghost supposed to be that of a gardener who drowned there 96 The Grey Lady allegedly haunts the terrace the library and the chapel Legg suggests that she has a young and beautiful appearance with a sad tear stained face and golden hair and smelling of the lilies of the valley Lal argues that she has reddish brown hair and wears a grey sleeveless robe 27 97 The Grey Lady s husband has been reported to haunt the stables and the chapel drawing room The ghost of a young child allegedly haunts the library and the Fleur de Lys room the child has supposedly been heard crying and attempts to hold visitors hands Folklore holds that the Grey Lady was the child s mother 97 A lady dressed in the style of Queen Anne and a knight in armour are reported to have been seen in the chapel drawing room The chapel itself is purportedly frequented by the ghost of a lady in 17th century dress and by that of a nun A young man dressed in 1920s tennis garb reputed to be a Cope family member who fell from a train has supposedly been seen in the reception area of the house A small boy documented to haunt the terrace is said to have fallen from the roof sometime in the 18th century 96 In addition Bramshill House was cited by the historian William Page as a possible location for the Legend of the Mistletoe Bough a ghost story associated with several English country mansions 7 This legend tells of a bride who supposedly hid in a wooden chest during a game of hide and seek on her wedding night In the case of Bramshill House the story has it that this happened at Christmas time and that the bride was found fifty years later still wearing her wedding dress and with a sprig of mistletoe in her hand the chest is on display in the entrance hall 27 The woman is sometimes identified as John Cope s daughter Anne who married Hugh Bethell of Yorkshire 98 An alternative claim is that she was Genevre Orsini who was married in 1727 and that her ghost came to Bramshill from Italy together with the chest 27 In his monograph on the house the Victorian writer Sir William Cope preferred this theory and added that the chest on display was not the original which had been proved large enough by a woman of comely proportions who had tested it by lying down in it but which had been taken away by Sir Denzil Cope s widow in 1812 99 The ghost of the bride is referred to as the White Lady and she is said by Legg to haunt the Fleur de Lys room 100 According to Legg Michael I of Romania asked to be moved to another room during a stay there in order to not be disturbed by the young woman in white who passed through his bedroom every night 97 An old man with a grey beard thought by Legg to be the father or husband of the White Lady is reported to stare through windows and at the Mistletoe Chest 97 Coordinates 51 19 51 N 0 54 44 W 51 33083 N 0 91222 W 51 33083 0 91222
