Abu Muhammad Hasan al Kharrat Arabic حسن الخراط Ḥassan al Kharrāṭ 1861 note 1 25 December 1925 was one of the principal Syrian rebel commanders of the Great Syrian Revolt against the French Mandate His main area of operations was in Damascus and its Ghouta countryside He was killed in the struggle and is considered a hero by Syrians 4 As the qabaday local youths boss of the al Shaghour quarter of Damascus al Kharrat was connected with Nasib al Bakri a nationalist from the quarter s most influential family At al Bakri s invitation al Kharrat joined the revolt in August 1925 and formed a group of fighters from al Shaghour and other neighborhoods in the vicinity He led the rebel assault against Damascus briefly capturing the residence of French High Commissioner Maurice Sarrail before withdrawing amid heavy French bombardment Towards the end of 1925 relations grew tense between al Kharrat and other rebel leaders particularly Sa id al As and Ramadan al Shallash as they traded accusations of plundering villages or extorting local inhabitants Al Kharrat continued to lead operations in the Ghouta where he was ultimately killed in a French ambush The revolt dissipated by 1927 but he gained a lasting reputation as a martyr of the Syrian resistance to French rule Al Kharrat was born to a Sunni Muslim family in Damascus in 1861 during Ottoman rule in Syria 5 6 He served as the night watchman of the city s al Shaghour quarter and as a guard for the neighborhood s orchards 6 7 8 Damascus was captured by Arab rebels during World War I in October 1918 Afterward the Arab Club an Arab nationalist organization emerged in the city to raise support for the rebels 9 The club assisted the rebels leader Emir Faisal who formed a rudimentary government 9 Al Kharrat became an affiliate of the Arab Club and raised support for Faisal in al Shaghour 10 In July 1920 Faisal s government collapsed after its motley forces were defeated by the French at the Battle of Maysalun 11 Afterward the French ruled Syria under the aegis of their League of Nations mandate In the early years of French rule al Kharrat was al Shaghour s qabaday pl qabadayat 7 12 the traditional leader of a neighborhood s local toughs 13 The qabaday was informally charged with redressing grievances and defending a neighborhood s honor against local criminals or the encroachments of qabadayat from other neighborhoods 13 He was popularly characterized as an honorable man noted for his personal strength 13 and protection of minorities and the poor 14 The qabaday was considered an upholder of Arab traditions and customs the guardian of popular culture according to historian Philip S Khoury 13 14 Khoury asserts that al Kharrat was probably the most respected and esteemed qabaday of his day 12 Qabadayat normally shunned formal education 13 and historian Michael Provence maintains that al Kharrat was likely illiterate 15 Qabadayat were normally linked with particular city notables and could secure them political support in their neighborhoods 13 Al Kharrat was allied with Nasib al Bakri a Damascene politician and landowner 8 The al Bakri family was the most influential in al Shaghour and al Kharrat served as the family s principal connection and enforcer in the quarter 16 A revolt against French rule was launched in mid 1925 by the Druze sheikh chieftain Sultan Pasha al Atrash in the southern mountains of Jabal al Druze 8 As al Atrash s men scored decisive victories against the French Army of the Levant Syrian nationalists were inspired and the revolt spread northward to the countryside of Damascus and beyond 8 Al Bakri was the chief liaison between al Atrash and the emerging rebel movement in Damascus and the Ghouta 8 The Ghouta is the fertile plain surrounding Damascus 17 18 and its orchard groves and extensive waterways provided cover for the rebels and a base from which they could raid Damascus 19 In August al Bakri convinced al Kharrat to join the uprising 6 16 According to Provence al Kharrat was ideal for the job possessing a local following of young men notoriety outside the quarter good connections and a reputation for toughness 16 The group of fighters he commanded was known as isabat al Shawaghirah the band of al Shaghour 8 Though named after al Kharrat s quarter the band included twenty qabadayat and their armed retinues from other Damascus neighborhoods and nearby villages 20 note 2 His main areas of operation were in the vicinity of al Shaghour and the al Zur forest in the eastern Ghouta 15 Through his alliance with a Sufi religious leader al Kharrat brought an Islamic holy war dimension to the largely secular revolt something that was not welcomed by some involved 16 Al Kharrat commenced guerrilla operations in September targeting French forces posted in the eastern and southern Ghouta 20 His prominence rose as he led nighttime raids against the French in Damascus during which he disarmed army patrols and took soldiers hostage 6 In al Shaghour Souk Saruja and Jazmatiyya al Kharrat and his band burnt down all French held buildings 6 In the first week of October sixty French gendarmes were dispatched to the Ghouta to apprehend al Kharrat and his fighters 3 The gendarmes were quartered in the home of al Malihah s mukhtar village headman 3 In the evening the rebels attacked the residence killing one gendarme and capturing the rest the prisoners were eventually all returned unharmed 3 On 12 October French troops backed by tanks artillery and aerial support launched an operation to surround and eliminate al Kharrat s rebels in the al Zur forest 21 Al Kharrat s men were forewarned of the French deployment by the peasants of al Malihah 21 Positioned among the trees the rebels used sniper fire against the French troops 21 The latter were unable to lure the rebels out and retreated 21 As the French withdrew toward al Malihah they looted the village and set it on fire 21 French intelligence officials justified the collective punishment of al Malihah as retaliation for the rebels capture and humiliation of the gendarmes during the previous week the French claimed a young boy from al Malihah had notified al Kharrat s men of the French presence in the village 22 Though they were unable to engage al Kharrat and his forces directly French troops executed around 100 civilians from Ghouta villages 22 Their corpses were brought to Damascus and the bodies of sixteen men described by the French as brigands were put on display 22 Spurred by French army actions in the Ghouta al Bakri planned to capture the Citadel of Damascus where French forces were concentrated and the Azm Palace where General Maurice Sarrail the French high commissioner of Syria would be residing on 17 18 October Sarrail was typically headquartered in Beirut 22 The high commissioner functioned as the overall administrator of Syria on behalf of France and exercised practically absolute power 23 The rebel units active in Damascus at the time were al Kharrat s isabat and a mixed force of Druze fighters and rebels from the al Midan quarter and the Ghouta 24 To compensate for the lack of rebel strength al Bakri sent a letter to Sultan al Atrash requesting reinforcements 22 Al Atrash replied that he was currently occupied with operations in the Hauran but would dispatch his entire force to back the Damascus rebels as soon as affairs there were settled 22 Before he received al Atrash s reply al Bakri decided to move ahead with the operation 24 On 18 October al Kharrat led forty rebels into al Shaghour from the old cemeteries adjacent to the southern gate of Damascus announcing that the Druze had arrived to relieve the city from French occupation 24 Crowds of residents enthusiastically welcomed the rebels and many took up arms alongside them Al Kharrat s men captured the quarter s police station disarming its garrison 24 They were joined by Ramadan al Shallash a rebel commander from Deir ez Zor and twenty of his Bedouin fighters The joint forces proceeded to the Hamidiyya Market and captured the Azm Palace 24 25 but Sarrail was not present having already left to attend a meeting in the Hauran town of Daraa 24 The rebels plundered the palace and set it on fire 24 Provence asserts that capturing the palace without Sarrail held no tactical importance but was a highly symbolic achievement for the rebels because of the Azm Palace s importance as the historical seat of economic and political power in Damascus now usurped by the French and totally undefended 24 While al Kharrat captured the Azm Palace al Bakri and 200 rebels under his command rode through the city and were joined by civilians in increasing numbers 24 After sealing the Old City to prevent the entry of enemy reinforcements al Kharrat issued an order to kill anyone linked to the French army 25 About 180 French soldiers were killed 25 Sarrail ordered the shelling and aerial bombardment of the city which lasted two days and killed about 1 500 people 26 Chaos and scattered fighting ensued as whole neighborhoods mosques and churches were leveled French forces moved in and hundreds of leading figures in the Syrian national movement were arrested 25 including al Kharrat s son Fakhri 8 The latter was captured on 22 October during a botched nighttime raid by the rebels against the French who had by then retaken Damascus 15 Al Kharrat was offered the release of his son in exchange for his own surrender but refused 27 The rebels withdrew from Damascus as a meeting was held between French army commander Maurice Gamelin and a delegation of Damascene notables 28 As a result of the meeting the French agreed to end their bombardment in return for a payment of 100 000 Turkish gold liras by 24 October 26 The fine was not paid by the French deadline but the bombardment was not renewed likely as a result of orders from the French government in Paris 29 International condemnation of Sarrail s bombardment of Damascus and growing criticism in France of his mishandling of the revolt led to his dismissal on 30 October 30 He was replaced by politician Henry de Jouvenel 31 who arrived in Syria in December 32 On 22 November al Kharrat commanded 700 rebels in a battle with about 500 French soldiers outside of Damascus 33 Al Kharrat s men inflicted trifling losses on the French but experienced heavy casualties themselves with thirty dead and forty wounded according to Reuters 33 On 5 December al Kharrat was one of the commanders of a 2 000 strong force uniting rebels from disparate backgrounds which assaulted the French Army barracks in al Qadam south of Damascus The French claimed to have inflicted significant casualties but rebel activity continued 34 Centralized order and oversight among the revolt s armed participants was difficult to establish because of the diversity and independence of the rebel factions A meeting of rebel leaders was held in the Ghouta village of Saqba on 26 November 35 Sa id al As accused al Kharrat and others of plundering in the Ghouta 36 while al Kharrat alleged that al Shallash extorted the residents of al Midan and the Ghouta town of Douma 37 The meeting concluded with an agreement to elect a government to replace the French authorities increase recruitment of the Ghouta s inhabitants coordinate military operations under a central command and establish a revolutionary court to execute spies 36 The meeting also designated the area between the village of Zabdin and north of the Douma Damascus road as being part of al Kharrat s zone of operations 36 Despite his leading role in the rebels military efforts al Kharrat was not included in the newly formed rebel leadership council nor were any of al Bakri s allies 36 Instead al As served as the rebels overall head 36 Sharp divisions among rebel factions became apparent during a second meeting in Saqba on 5 December According to Syrian journalist Munir al Rayyes hostility between al Kharrat and al Shallash was well known among the rebels 35 Because al Shallash had levied war taxes on the major landlords and city elites of the Ghouta al Kharrat s benefactor al Bakri viewed him as a threat to the traditional landowning class to which al Bakri belonged 38 Al Rayyis claimed the meeting was called for by al Kharrat 39 who ordered his fighters to capture and bring al Shallash to Saqba 40 However according to al As the summit was called by al Shallash and once the latter arrived in the village al Kharrat personally detained him and confiscated his horse weapons and money 40 After his detention al Shallash was given a brief trial during which al Kharrat accused him of making impositions and ransoms and financial collections in the name of the revolt while al Bakri condemned him specifically for extorting the residents of Douma for 1 000 giney Ottoman pounds 35 and imposing large fines on the inhabitants of Harran al Awamid al Qisa and Maydaa for his own personal enrichment 41 Al Kharrat and al Bakri decided al Shallash s verdict and dismissed him from the revolt 38 While many rebels with officer backgrounds similar to al Shallash disapproved of the judgement they did not intervene 35 In his account of the meeting al Rayyis condemned the rebel commanders for complacency in the ridiculous trial and accused al Kharrat of being motivated solely by personal animosity 39 Al Shallash was able to escape or was released by al As when French planes bombed the meeting 40 Al Shallash would later surrender to Jouvenel and collaborate with French authorities 42 Al Kharrat was killed in an ambush by French troops in the Ghouta on 25 December 1925 39 He was succeeded as qabaday of al Shaghour and commander of the isabat al Shawaghirah by Mahmud Khaddam al Srija 12 Al Kharrat s men continued to fight the French until the revolt ended in 1927 43 though historian Thomas Philipp states that al Kharrat s group dissipated after his death 44 In January 1926 al Kharrat s son Fakhri was sentenced to death and publicly executed with two other rebels in Marjeh Square Damascus 45 The French had previously implored Fakhri to persuade his father to surrender in return for his release but Fakhri refused 15 Abd al Rahman Shahbandar a prominent Syrian nationalist leader described al Kharrat as having played the preeminent role in the battle against the French in the Ghouta and Damascus 7 Historian Daniel Neep wrote that al Kharrat was the best known of all of the Damascus based rebel leaders 8 although other leaders of the rebel movement attributed the publicity and praise of al Kharrat to the efforts of the Cairo based Syrian Palestinian Committee with which al Bakri was closely affiliated Al Kharrat and his son Fakhri are today considered martyred heroes by Syrians for their nationalist efforts and their deaths in the Syrian struggle for independence from France 16 39
