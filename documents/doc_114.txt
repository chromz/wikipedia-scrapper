James Hogun died January 4 1781 was an Irish American military officer who was as one of five generals from North Carolina to serve with the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War Born in Ireland Hogan migrated to North Carolina then a British colony in 1751 Settling in Halifax County he raised a family and established himself as a prominent local figure A member of the county s Committee of Safety he represented it at the North Carolina Provincial Congress and helped to draft the first Constitution of North Carolina Initially a major in the 7th North Carolina Regiment Hogun advanced quickly in rank during 1776 to become the unit s commanding officer He participated in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown in 1777 The Continental Congress promoted Hogun to brigadier general in 1779 although several congressmen and the North Carolina General Assembly wished to see Thomas Clark of North Carolina promoted instead Hogun was in command of North Carolina s line brigade during the Siege of Charleston in the spring of 1780 which ended in the surrender of all but one of North Carolina s regiments of regular infantry as well as more than 5 000 Patriot soldiers under Major General Benjamin Lincoln Hogun was the highest ranking officer from North Carolina to be captured and imprisoned after the surrender of Charleston and despite being offered the opportunity to leave internment under a parole that was generally extended to other captured Continental officers he remained in a British prisoner of war camp near Charleston Hogun likely chose imprisonment in order to prevent the British Army from recruiting Continental soldiers for its campaign in the West Indies He became ill and died in the prison on Haddrel s Point a peninsula in Charleston s harbor Much of Hogun s early life remains unknown due to his relative obscurity until the American Revolutionary War He immigrated to North Carolina from Ireland his place of birth in 1751 and on October 3 that year he married Ruth Norfleet 1 The couple had a son Lemuel Hogun made his home near the modern day community of Hobgood in Halifax County 2 In 1774 Hogun became a member of the Halifax County Committee of Safety which indicated his rise to prominence since arriving in the colony 23 years prior 3 Between August 1775 and November 1776 Hogun represented Halifax County in the Third Fourth and Fifth North Carolina Provincial Congresses and demonstrated an interest in military matters 3 As a delegate Hogun assisted in drafting the first Constitution of North Carolina 1 Hogun was named a major in the 7th North Carolina Regiment in April 1776 2 and was given command of the unit on November 26 1776 1 Initially the regiment had some difficulty organizing after several of the officers delayed their military work in order to take care of their personal affairs Hogun was forced to reprimand his officers sharply threatening them with the loss of their commissions At the same time currents of doubt ran through North Carolina as Loyalists attempted to hinder enlistment of Patriots by spreading rumors about the imminent demise of the Patriot army in the north and disease that was allegedly ravaging that force 4 While commanding his regiment Hogun fought against the British Army in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown and was present at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777 78 1 In 1778 Hogun was given orders to assist in recruiting the so called additional regiments requested by the Continental Congress from North Carolina and afterwards was ordered to West Point with the first regiment so recruited 5 After his arrival and throughout the late autumn and winter of 1778 79 Hogun s regiment served on a work detail tasked with building up the fortifications at West Point Hogun was not satisfied with this task but his men lacked sufficient weapons to allow them to serve as a combat unit at that time Approximately 400 muskets had to be requisitioned for the regiment to be fully armed 6 In early 1779 Major General Benedict Arnold then Commandant of Philadelphia Pennsylvania requested that General George Washington send him an additional regiment of Continental soldiers to guard the Patriot stores in Philadelphia Hogun was sent to Arnold with his newly recruited regiment arriving on or before January 19 1779 5 On January 9 1779 while en route to Philadelphia Hogun was promoted to brigadier general by the Continental Congress 5 His promotion came about in part as a result of what Thomas Burke a delegate to the Continental Congress from North Carolina and a fellow Irishman termed the distinguished intrepidity Hogun had exhibited at Germantown 7 This caused some controversy as the North Carolina General Assembly which was customarily consulted for the promotion of generals from that state had already nominated Thomas Clark and Jethro Sumner for promotion to the rank of brigadier general 5 Sumner was promoted but Clark was passed over in favor of Hogun who received the support of nine of the thirteen states 8 Hogun s surprising victory was due in large part to Burke s lobbying efforts among his colleagues in the Continental Congress 5 By political conventions governing such matters Burke was bound by the vote of the North Carolina General Assembly to support the state legislature s recommendations of Clark and Sumner but he worked to convince other Congressmen to vote for Hogun over Clark 7 Hogun was appointed to succeed Arnold as Commandant of Philadelphia on March 19 1779 serving until November 22 that year 5 In November 1779 Hogun took command of the North Carolina Brigade of the North Carolina Line composed of the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th North Carolina Regiments Through the winter of 1779 80 Hogun led the brigade of about 700 men 9 from Philadelphia to Charleston South Carolina where he was placed under the command of Major General Benjamin Lincoln 10 The march was arduous and Hogun s brigade endured one of the coldest harshest winters in years 11 Hogun s command arrived at Charleston on March 13 1780 11 which according to Lincoln gave great spirit to the Town and confidence to the Army 12 The North Carolinians were immediately put to the task of defending the city which was threatened with a siege by British General Henry Clinton in early March 11 Shortly after Hogun s arrival many of North Carolina s militia present in the city began to return home because their enlistment terms ended on or about March 24 The militiamen had only agreed to serve limited terms and as they were not under Hogun s direct command he was powerless to stop them leaving 13 Charleston was principally located on a peninsula and so Lincoln aligned his Continental units in defensive works that barricaded the neck of the peninsula using a line of redoubts redans and batteries These defensive works were connected by a parapet and commanded from a concrete hornwork jutting out from the defensive line 14 In front of the fortifications the Patriot forces dug an 18 foot wide moat and between the moat and parapet they constructed a line of abatis to stall any British assault 15 When the siege by the British Army began in earnest on April 1 Hogun and his men were positioned on the right of the Continental Army s lines near the Cooper River 16 Hogun participated in a council of war on April 20 1780 Several members of the South Carolina Privy Council a part of the civilian government threatened to block the Continental Army s attempts to withdraw from Charleston if the council of war voted to do so 17 Although the defending army had only eight to ten days worth of provisions 18 Lincoln bowed to pressure from civil authorities and delayed evacuation On April 26 another council of war at which Hogun was present determined that the British presence on all sides of the city prevented the army s escape 19 For the next two weeks the British and Patriot forces exchanged artillery and rifle fire at all times of day and the British bombardment whittled down the American breastworks 20 On May 8 Lincoln called another council of war with all his army s general and field officers and ships captains to discuss terms of surrender that had been proposed by Clinton 21 Of the 61 officers in attendance at that council 49 including Hogun voted to offer terms of capitulation with the British commander 22 When these were rejected hostilities continued and Lincoln called another council of war on May 11 to further discuss terms of capitulation The council voted to present further terms to Clinton which he accepted 23 On May 12 1780 Hogun was among the officers under Lincoln who formally surrendered to the British Army along with approximately 5 000 Continental and militia soldiers 10 The surrender led to the loss of all but one of the regiments of the North Carolina Line then in existence depriving the state of all regular non militia soldiers 10 As a brigadier general Hogun held the highest rank of the approximately 814 Continental soldiers from North Carolina who capitulated at Charleston 24 Rather than allowing himself to be paroled Hogun requested he be taken prisoner and was interned at the British prison camp at Haddrel s Point on Point Pleasant located in what is now Mount Pleasant South Carolina across from Sullivan s Island 25 Hogun s decision was based in part on his desire to stifle the recruiting efforts of the British who sought to enlist captured Continental soldiers to serve in the British West Indies 5 The British however held only the officers at Haddrel s Point deciding to house the enlisted men in barracks in Charleston 26 Officers at Haddrel s Point were subjected to harsh treatment barred from fishing to catch much needed food and threatened with deportation from South Carolina 10 Approximately 3 300 Patriot soldiers were confined in prison camps around Charleston that were similar to the one at Haddrel s Point and many were destined for cramped unsanitary prison ships 27 Because of the conditions many Continental soldiers agreed to join Loyalist regiments but Hogun and other officers set up courts martial in the camps and attempted to maintain a dignified military structure 25 Hogun s health soon declined and he died in the prison camp on January 4 1781 28 He was buried in an unmarked grave 29 On March 14 1786 the North Carolina legislature granted Hogun s son Lemuel a 12 000 acre 4 900 ha 19 sq mi tract near modern day Nashville Tennessee in recognition of his father s service 30 The elder Hogun was one of twenty two Patriot generals who perished during the American Revolutionary War and one of twelve who died from disease or other non combat causes 31 In the early 20th century North Carolina jurist and historian Walter Clark noted that while the careers of three of North Carolina s other generals Brigadier Generals Francis Nash and James Moore and Major General Robert Howe were well known to contemporary historians the story of Hogun s career as well as that of Jethro Sumner had been neglected 32 Hogun s personal papers appear to have been destroyed while in the possession of his descendants in Alabama during the American Civil War leaving virtually no surviving correspondence that would shed further light on his life 30 In 1954 the North Carolina Highway Historical Marker Program a division of the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources erected a historical marker in Hogun s honor near his former home in Halifax County 2
