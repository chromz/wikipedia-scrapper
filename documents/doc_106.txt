number of hand grenades then known as bombs to deal with a strongly barricaded German post that was holding out between their company and the one on their right Jensen was a member of this party 19 His actions during the reduction of this post resulted in a recommendation for the Victoria Cross 1 the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed

He had still a bomb in one hand and taking another from his pocket he drew the pin with his teeth Threatening them with two bombs he called on them in German to surrender and bluffed them that they were surrounded by Australians The enemy dropped their rifles and gave in Jensen then sent a German to tell another enemy party who were fighting our Stokes Gun to surrender and they too gave in A different party of our men then saw these Germans for the first time and began firing on them At considerable risk Jensen stood up on the barricade waved his helmet and sent the German prisoners back to our line under an escort of lightly wounded men During the assault on Noreuil Jensen also freed Australian prisoners and assisted in the mopping up of German resistance in the village itself when
