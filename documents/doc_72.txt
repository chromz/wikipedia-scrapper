Guard Air Station Port Angeles They were then assigned to the Treasury class cutter USCGC Spencer serving aboard the vessel until 1941 12 During the course of his military service Munro received consistently high marks on his performance evaluations and according to Evans expressed a desire to become a career Coast Guardsman 5 30 9 In mid 1941 with tension with Japan on the rise the U S government began emergency mobilization and transferred the Coast Guard from the Department of the Treasury to the Department of the Navy Munro and Evans volunteered for reassignment to the attack transport USS Hunter Liggett which was being outfitted and manned by the Coast Guard as part of preparations for War Plan Orange 12 15 323 324 16 17 By mid 1942 Hunter Liggett had been assigned to Transport Division 17 tasked with supporting the Guadalcanal Campaign 5 41 In preparation for the planned amphibious operations Navy personnel began training as small boat handlers under Coast Guard tutelage owing to the shortage of coxswains Munro and Evans volunteered to join the training 5 78 Prior to the initial landings at the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu Tanambogo Munro was posted to Rear Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner s staff aboard USS McCawley 18 14 Cross trained as both a coxswain and a signalman he was ordered to ferry troops to shore during the third attack wave then beach his boat and attach himself to a U S Marine unit to help manage ship to shore communication 5 95 96 Following the Allied victory at Tulagi and Gavutu Tanambogo Munro and Evans were among Coast Guard and Navy personnel who staffed Naval Operating Base NOB Cactus at Lunga Point on the northern coast of Guadalcanal NOB Cactus served as a communication hub between land forces and offshore vessels 18 14 19 Established on August 9 by Coast Guard Commander Dwight Dexter NOB Cactus is the only known instance of a naval operating base primarily led by Coast Guard personnel 20 Munro volunteered for assignment at Lunga Point Dexter was his favorite officer 21 According to U S Marine Master Sergeant James Hurlbut Munro and Evans lived at the base in an approximately 80 square feet 7 4 m2 hut they had made from packing boxes and scrap material which he also described as quite a swank establishment for Guadalcanal 22 On September 20 1942 Munro volunteered to lead a small boat search and rescue mission seeking to recover the crew of a Navy airplane that had been forced down off Savo Island During the operation Munro s craft came under intense fire from Japanese shore positions though he was able to maneuver the boat back to base with only minor injuries to his crew The downed aircrew was ultimately found and rescued by a flying boat 5 42 On September 27 Lt Colonel Chesty Puller ordered three companies of Marines to attack the flank of Japanese positions on the west side of the Matanikau River Munro was placed in charge of two landing craft tank LCT and eight Higgins boats tasked with transporting the Marines to their landing points 4 4 Preceded by a beach clearing ship to shore bombardment from the destroyer USS Monssen the amphibious force landed and began moving inland towards its objective 5 47 Meanwhile Munro withdrew his boats to Lunga Point as ordered carrying with him injured sailors and Marines among them Navy coxswain Samuel B Roberts who had been mortally wounded while using his landing craft to draw Japanese fire away from the Marines 4 4 23 Meanwhile the U S Marine Corps landing force came under attack in a Japanese counter offensive and quickly found itself encircled on a hill With the Marines in danger of being overrun Monssen opened fire on the Japanese positions with her 5 inch 127 mm caliber guns managing to clear a narrow corridor to the beach Using Monssen s signal lamp Puller ordered the Marines to fight their way to the shore 24 At Lunga Point the landing craft were instructed to return and extract the besieged Marines 23 Commander Dexter asked Munro and Evans if they would take charge of the mission to which Munro answered Hell yes 4 4 23 As the boats under Munro s charge approached the recovery points they came under heavy fire from Japanese forces at a ridge abandoned by the Marines Munro used a 30 caliber machine gun aboard his landing craft to direct suppressing fire against the Japanese positions as the other boats recovered the American forces With Japanese troops moving against the beach Munro piloted his boat closer to shore to act as a shield Though the initial extraction was successful one of the LCTs became grounded on a sandbar Munro directed the other LCT to help extricate the grounded vessel as he maneuvered his own boat to shield the Marines from Japanese fire from the shore Munro was shot in the base of his skull and lost consciousness 4 4 The LCT was ultimately freed and the boats resumed their withdrawal When out of range of Japanese forces Munro briefly regained consciousness before succumbing to his wounds According to Evans his dying words were Did they get off 4 4 5 9 Evans said later that seeing my affirmative nod he smiled with that smile I knew and liked so well and then he was gone 23 Munro was buried on September 28 1942 the day after his death on Guadalcanal 4 5 In a letter to James Munro Hurlbut described Munro s grave as being marked by a wooden cross constructed by Evans 22 According to Munro s biographer Williams the public details of Munro s actions were first chronicled in The Seattle Times on October 15 1942 though initial reports did not reveal Munro had been killed in action 5 59 Four days later Coast Guard officers arrived at the home of Munro s parents in South Cle Elum to inform them of his death A memorial service was held on November 1 at the Holy Nativity Episcopal Church in South Cle Elum The Washington State Guard and American Legion volunteers provided sentries and a cordon of honor outside the church 5 168 Colonel Puller the Marine officer who had ordered the attack in which Munro perished nominated the Coast Guardsman for the Medal of Honor the highest U S personal military decoration 5 64 23 The nomination was endorsed by Admiral William Halsey Jr and President of the United States Franklin Roosevelt approved the decoration on or about May 1 1943 5 64 The medal was presented to Munro s parents on May 24 by Roosevelt in a White House ceremony 9 The citation reads For extraordinary heroism and conspicuous gallantry in action above and beyond the call of duty as Officer in Charge of a group of Higgins boats engaged in the evacuation of a Battalion of Marines trapped by enemy Japanese forces at Point Cruz Guadalcanal on September 27 1942 After making preliminary plans for the evacuation of nearly 500 beleaguered Marines Munro under constant risk of his life daringly led five of his small craft toward the shore As he closed the beach he signaled the others to land and then in order to draw the enemy s fire and protect the heavily loaded boats he valiantly placed his craft with its two small guns as a shield between the beachhead and the Japanese When the perilous task of evacuation was nearly completed Munro was killed by enemy fire but his crew two of whom were wounded carried on until the last boat had loaded and cleared the beach By his outstanding leadership expert planning and dauntless devotion to duty he and his courageous comrades undoubtedly saved the lives of many who otherwise would have perished He gallantly gave up his life in defense of his country 25 As of 2020 Munro is the
