members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces In November 1943 during the Second World War Derrick was awarded the Victoria Cross for his assault on a heavily defended Japanese position at Sattelberg New Guinea During the engagement he scaled a cliff face while under heavy fire and silenced seven machine gun posts before leading his platoon in a charge that destroyed a further three Born in the Adelaide suburb of Medindie South Australia Derrick left school at the age of fourteen and found work in a bakery As the Great Depression grew worse he lost his job and moved to Berri working on a fruit farm before marrying in 1939 In July 1941 Derrick enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force joining the 2 48th Battalion He was posted to the Middle East where he took part in the Siege of Tobruk was recommended for the Military Medal and promoted to corporal Later at El Alamein Derrick was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for knocking out three German machine gun posts destroying two tanks and capturing one hundred prisoners Derrick returned to Australia with his battalion in February 1943 before transferring to the South West Pacific Theatre where he fought in the battle to capture Lae Back in Australia the following February he was posted to an officer cadet training unit being commissioned lieutenant in November 1944 In April 1945 his battalion was sent to the Pacific island of Morotai an assembly point for the Allied invasion of the Philippines Engaged in action the following month on the heavily defended hill Freda on Tarakan Island Derrick was hit by five bullets from a Japanese machine gun He died from his wounds on 24 May 1945 Derrick was born in the Adelaide suburb of Medindie South Australia on 20 March 1914 to David Derrick a labourer from Ireland and his Australian wife Ada n√©e Whitcombe The Derricks were poor and Tom often walked barefoot to attend Sturt Street Public School and later Le Fevre Peninsula School 1 In 1928 aged fourteen Derrick left school and found work in a bakery By this time he had developed a keen interest in sports particularly cricket Australian Rules Football boxing and swimming his diving in the Port River earned him the nickname of Diver 2 With the advent of the Great Depression Derrick scraped a living from odd jobs such as fixing bicycles and selling newspapers to supplement his job as a baker When in 1931 the Depression worsened Derrick lost his bakery job and with friends headed by bicycle for the regional town of Berri approximately 225 kilometres 140 mi away in search of work 3 Jobs in Berri were hard to come by and Derrick and two friends spent the next few months living in a tent on the banks of the Murray River When the annual Royal Adelaide Show opened that year Derrick went to the boxing pavilion to accept a challenge of staying upright for three rounds with the ex lightweight champion of Australia Although he was knocked down in the second round he immediately got back to his feet and won the bet albeit at the cost of a black eye and a few bruised ribs 2 Eventually towards the end of 1931 Derrick found work picking fruit at a vineyard in Winkie a short distance outside Berri He later moved on to a full time job at a nearby fruit farm remaining there for the next nine years 4 On 24 June 1939 Derrick married Clarance Violet Beryl Leslie his one true love whom he had met at a dance in Adelaide seven years earlier 2 at St Laurence s Catholic Church North Adelaide 1 Derrick did not join up when war broke out in September 1939 but like many Australians enlisted after the fall of France in June 1940 5 He joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 5 July 1940 6 and was posted to the 2 48th Battalion 26th Brigade as a private Derrick first joined his unit at the Wayville Showgrounds before basic training at Woodside 7 8 Derrick thrived on military life but found discipline difficult to accept 5 In October the 2 48th Battalion paraded through the streets of Adelaide to Mitcham railway station prior to its embarkation for the Middle East The battalion s voyage overseas was postponed until 17 November when the unit boarded the SS Stratheden 7 The ship made a stop at Perth where Derrick was confined on board for going absent without leave to sightsee He was soon in more trouble and was charged and fined for punching another soldier who taunted him over this incident 5 On arrival in Palestine the 2 48th Battalion encamped at El Kantara and began training in desert warfare For relaxation the battalion set up athletic events and Derrick became well known for often winning cross country races and for organising a book on the outcomes 7 In March 1941 the unit went by train and truck to Alexandria Egypt then along the North African coast to Cyrenaica in Libya to join the 9th Australian Division 8 9 After the 2 48th Battalion completed its training with the 9th Division at Cyrenaica 8 they were moved further along the coast to Gazala Then just as they began to dig in the battalion was abruptly withdrawn to Tobruk in response to the German Afrika Korps advance 9 They entered Tobruk on 9 April 1941 and spent the following eight months besieged by Axis forces 8 While there Derrick acquired an Italian Breda machine gun and regularly led fighting patrols against both German and Italian troops 9 Although Derrick s bravery was noted during the siege he wrote in his diary about his constant fear of dying 10 On the night of 30 April the Axis forces assaulted Tobruk s outer defences and managed to capture substantial ground In response the 2 48th Battalion was ordered to counter attack the following evening During the ensuing engagement Derrick fought as a section member in the far left flank of the attack After suffering heavy casualties in what Derrick described as a bobby dazzler of a fire fight the battalion was forced to withdraw Praised for his leadership and bravery during the assault 11 Derrick was immediately promoted to corporal 3 11 and recommended for the Military Medal The award however was never made 11 In late May Derrick discovered a German posing as a British tank officer and reported him to company headquarters the man was immediately arrested as a spy 12 Following a period of heavy fighting in June the 2 48th Battalion was placed in reserve for a few days the following month Promoted to platoon sergeant in September Derrick along with the rest of his battalion was withdrawn from Tobruk and returned to Palestine aboard HMS Kingston on 22 October Disembarking at Tel Aviv they were given three days leave in the city before returning for training 12 Following a period of rest and light garrison duties in Syria the 2 48th Battalion was rushed to El Alamein Egypt to reinforce the British Eighth Army 8 During the First Battle of El Alamein on 10 July 1942 4 Derrick took part in the 26th Australian Brigade s attack on Tel el Eisa 8 In the initial assault Derrick against a barrage of German grenades led an attack against three machine gun posts and succeeded in destroying the positions before capturing over one hundred prisoners 1 4 During the Axis counter attack that evening the Australian line was overrun by tanks As the German infantry following the tanks advanced Derrick s company led a charge against the men 12 During the engagement Derrick managed to destroy two German tanks using sticky bombs 1 4 Commended for his outstanding leadership and courage Derrick was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his part in the fighting at Tel el Eisa 13 The award was announced in a supplement to the London Gazette on 18 February 1943 14 Private Joe Ratta 15 Promoted to sergeant on 28 July 4 Derrick led a six man reconnaissance on 3 October successfully pinpointing several German machine gun positions and strongholds this information was to be vital for the upcoming Second Battle of El Alamein 16 The El Alamein offensive was launched on 23 October with the 9th Australian Division taking part 8 At one point during the engagement Derrick jumped up onto an Allied gun carrier heading towards the Germans Armed with a Thompson submachine gun and under intense heavy fire Derrick attacked and knocked out three machine gun posts while standing in the carrier He then had the driver reverse up to each post so he could ensure each position was silenced By the following morning Derrick s platoon occupied all three posts The members of the 2 48th Battalion who witnessed Derrick s action were sure he would be awarded the Victoria Cross though no recommendation was made 15 For part of 31 October Derrick assumed command of his company after all of the unit s officers had been killed or wounded in fierce fighting 17 On 21 November 1942 Derrick was briefly admitted to the 2 3rd Australian Field Ambulance with slight shrapnel wounds to his right hand and buttock 18 Twelve days later the 2 48th Battalion left El Alamein and returned to Gaza in Palestine 8 where later that month Derrick attended a corps patrolling course 18 In January 1943 the 2 48th Battalion sailed home to Australia aboard the S S Nieuw Amsterdam along with the rest of the 9th Division 8 19 Disembarking at Port Melbourne in late February 1943 8 19 Derrick was granted a period of leave and travelled by train to Adelaide where he spent time with Beryl He rejoined his battalion now encamped in the outskirts of Adelaide before they went by train to the Atherton Tableland for training in jungle warfare Brought up to full strength by the end of April the 2 48th Battalion completed its training following landing craft exercises near Cairns 19 On 23 July Derrick was attached to the 21st Brigade Headquarters but admitted to hospital for old injuries to his right eye later the same day 18 After hospital Derrick returned briefly to Brigade before rejoining the 2 48th Battalion on 27 August 18 For much of August the 2 48th Battalion had been in training for the Allied attack on Lae in Papua New Guinea 1 19 The unit s objective was to land on a strip of land designated as Red Beach and then fight their way approximately 30 kilometres 19 mi west towards Lae Following a bombardment by American destroyers Derrick s wave landed on the beach with minimal casualties on 4 September Ten days later the 2 48th Battalion s C Company led by Derrick s platoon captured Malahang airstrip before Lae fell to the Allies on 16 September 19 Derrick was scornful of the Japanese defence of Lae and wrote in his diary that our greatest problem was trying to catch up with the retreating Japanese force 20 Following Lae the 9th Division was tasked to seize Finschhafen clear the Huon Peninsula and gain control of the Vitiaz Strait By 2 October one of the division s brigades had gained a foothold on Finschhafen but soon encountered fierce Japanese resistance In response to a Japanese counter attack the 26th Brigade was transferred to reinforce the Australian position on 20 October and when the division switched to the offensive in November the brigade was ordered to capture Sattelberg 4 Sattelberg was a densely wooded hill rising 1 000 metres 1 100 yd and dominating the Finschhafen region 21 it was in an assault on this position that Derrick was to earn the Victoria Cross 22 Sergeant Tom Derrick 21 The Australian attack on Sattelberg began in mid November with the Japanese slowly giving ground and withdrawing back up the precipitous slopes Each side suffered heavy casualties and on 20 November Derrick who had been acting as company sergeant major for the previous month was given command of B Company s 11 platoon after the unit had lost all but one of their leaders 21 By 22 November the 2 23rd and 2 48th Battalions had reached the southern slopes of Sattelberg holding a position approximately 600 metres 660 yd from the summit A landslide had blocked the only road so the final assault was made by infantry alone without supporting tanks 4 On 24 November the 2 48th Battalion s B Company was ordered to outflank a strong Japanese position sited on a cliff face prior to attacking a feature 140 metres 150 yd from the Sattelberg township The nature of the terrain meant that the only possible route was up a slope covered with kunai grass directly beneath the cliffs Over a period of two hours the Australians made several attempts to clamber up the slopes to reach their objective but each time they were repulsed by intense machine gun fire and grenade attacks As dusk fell it appeared impossible to reach the objective or even hold the ground already gained and the company was ordered to withdraw 4 23 In response Derrick replied to his company commander Bugger the CO Just give me twenty more minutes and we ll have this place Tell him I m pinned down and can t get out 24 Moving forward with his platoon Derrick attacked a Japanese post that had been holding up the advance He destroyed the position with grenades and ordered his second section around to the right flank The section soon came under heavy machine gun and grenade fire from six Japanese posts 4 23 Clambering up the cliff face under heavy fire Derrick held on with one hand while lobbing grenades into the weapon pits with the other like a man shooting for a goal at basketball 24 Climbing further up the cliff and in full view of the Japanese Derrick continued to attack the posts with grenades before following up with accurate rifle fire Within twenty minutes he had reached the peak and cleared seven posts 24 while the demoralised Japanese defenders fled from their positions to the buildings of Sattelberg 21 23 Derrick then returned to his platoon where he gathered his first and third sections in preparation for an assault on the three remaining machine gun posts in the area Attacking the posts Derrick personally rushed forward on four separate occasions and threw his grenades at a range of about 7 metres 7 7 yd before all three were silenced 4 23 Derrick s platoon held their position that night 21 before the 2 48th Battalion moved in to take Sattelberg unopposed the following morning 4 The battalion commander insisted that Derrick personally hoist the Australian flag over the town 21 it was raised at 10 00 on 25 November 1943 4 The final assault on Sattelberg became known within the 2 48th Battalion as Derrick s Show 25 Although he was already a celebrity within the 9th Division the action brought him to wide public attention 26 On 23 March 1944 the announcement and accompanying citation for Derrick s Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the London Gazette It read 27 Government House Canberra 23rd March 1944 The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the award of the VICTORIA CROSS to Sergeant Thomas Currie Derrick D C M Australian Military Forces For most conspicuous courage outstanding leadership and devotion to duty during the final assault on Sattelberg in November 1943 On 24th November 1943 a company of an Australian Infantry Battalion was ordered to outflank a strong enemy position sited on a precipitous cliff face and then to attack a feature 150 yards from the township of Sattelberg Sergeant Derrick was in command of his platoon of the company Due to the nature of the country the only possible approach to the town lay through an open kunai patch situated directly beneath the top of the cliffs Over a period of two hours many attempts were made by our troops to clamber up the slopes to their objective but on each occasion the enemy prevented success with intense machine gun fire and grenades Shortly before last light it appeared that it would be impossible to reach the objective or even to hold the ground already occupied and the company was ordered to retire On receipt of this order Sergeant Derrick displaying dogged tenacity requested one last attempt to reach the objective His request was granted Moving ahead of his forward section he personally destroyed with grenades an enemy post which had been holding up this section He then ordered his second section around on the right flank This section came under heavy fire from light machine guns and grenades from six enemy posts Without regard for personal safety he clambered forward well ahead of the leading men of the section and hurled grenade after grenade so completely demoralising the enemy that they fled leaving weapons and grenades By this action alone the company was able to gain its first foothold on the precipitous ground Not content with the work already done he returned to the first section and together with the third section of his platoon advanced to deal with the three remaining posts in the area On four separate occasions he dashed forward and threw grenades at a range of six to eight yards until these positions were finally silenced In all Sergeant Derrick had reduced ten enemy posts From the vital ground he had captured the remainder of the Battalion moved on to capture Sattelberg the following morning Undoubtedly Sergeant Derrick s fine leadership and refusal to admit defeat in the face of a seemingly impossible situation resulted in the capture of Sattelberg His outstanding gallantry thoroughness and devotion to duty were an inspiration not only to his platoon and company but to the whole Battalion The 2 48th Battalion remained at Sattelberg until late December 1943 when it returned to the coast in order to regroup 28 On Christmas Eve Derrick noted in his diary that the next day would be his 4th Xmas overseas and I don t care where I spend the next one I only hope I m still on deck alive 10 On 7 February 1944 the battalion sailed from Finschhafen for Australia disembarking at Brisbane 18 Granted home leave Derrick made his way to South Australia for a short period with Beryl 28 In April he was admitted to hospital suffering from malaria before returning to his battalion the following month During this time he was charged with being absent without leave and subsequently forfeited a day s pay 18 On 20 August 1944 Derrick was posted to an officer cadet training unit in Victoria 18 He requested that he be allowed to rejoin the 2 48th Battalion at the end of the course 28 contrary to normal Army policy that prevented officers commissioned from the ranks from returning to their previous units An exemption was granted to Derrick only after much lobbying 29 30 While at this unit Derrick shared a tent with Reg Saunders who later became the Army s first Indigenous Australian officer 31 Commissioned as a lieutenant on 26 November 1944 Derrick was granted twenty four days leave 4 18 Returning to the 2 48th Battalion as a reinforcement officer his appointment as a platoon commander in his old company was met by great jubilation 26 During this period the battalion had been posted to Ravenshoe on the Atherton Tablelands for an extensive training period before being transported from Cairns to Morotai during April 1945 8 18 It was around this time that Derrick converted from his Church of England religious denomination and Salvationist beliefs to Catholicism his wife s religion though he was not overtly religious 32 33 On 1 May 1945 Derrick took part in the landing at Tarakan an island off the coast of Borneo 34 Under the cover of a naval and aerial bombardment 35 he led his men ashore in the initial waves of the landing where they were initially posted at the boundary of the 2 48th Battalion and 2 24th Battalion s area of responsibility 34 The Japanese force on the island mounted a determined resistance and Derrick was later quoted in the Sunday Sun as saying he had never struck anything so tough as the Japanese on Tarakan 36 Slowly pushing inland 35 the 2 48th Battalion s main task from 19 May was to capture a heavily defended hill code named Freda 37 Derrick s platoon unsuccessfully probed Japanese positions on that day and the next at a loss of two men killed with others wounded He later recorded in his diary that these setbacks were a bad show 38 On 21 May Derrick and Lieutenant Colonel Bob Ainslie the 2 48th Battalion s commander debated the optimum size of the unit which should be used to capture the Freda position Derrick successfully argued that a company was best given the restrictions posed by the terrain He was in high spirits that night possibly in an attempt to lift his platoon s morale 39 On 22 May Derrick s was one of two platoons that attacked a well defended knoll and captured the position Derrick played a key role in this action and coordinated both platoons during the final assault that afternoon 40 After capturing the knoll the two platoons reinforced by two sections of the 2 4th Commando Squadron dug in to await an expected Japanese counter attack At about 03 30 on 23 May a Japanese light machine gun fired into the Australian position 41 Derrick sat upright to see if his men were all right and was hit by five bullets from the gun s second burst striking him from his left hip to the right of his chest 1 His runner Curly Colby dragged him behind cover but Derrick could not be immediately evacuated as Japanese troops attacked at about 04 00 Derrick was in great pain and told Colby that he had had it 42 Despite his wounds he continued to issue orders for several hours When day broke it was discovered that Derrick s platoon were directly overlooked by a Japanese bunker though this would not have been visible during the assault late the previous evening 43 When stretcher bearers reached the position at dawn Derrick insisted that the other wounded be attended to first Derrick was carried off Freda later that morning where he was met by the 26th Brigade s commander Brigadier David Whitehead 44 The two men briefly conversed before Derrick excused himself fearing that he had not much time left and wishing to see the padre Stepping back Whitehead saluted and sent for Father Arch Bryson 35 At the hospital surgeons found that bullets had torn away much of Derrick s liver he died on 24 May 1945 during a second operation on his wounds 31 He was buried in the 2 48th Battalion s cemetery on Tarakan that afternoon 31 and later re interred at the Labuan War Cemetery plot 24 row A grave 9 45 Tom Derrick was widely mourned His widow Beryl became prostrate with grief on hearing of his death many members of the Army were affected 31 with one soldier lamenting it felt as if the whole war stopped 24 By the time Derrick s death was officially announced on 30 May most Australians on Tarakan had heard the news and rumours had spread claiming that he had been speared or shot at short range by a sub machine gun 31 The Japanese force on Tarakan learned of Derrick s death and tried to exploit it for propaganda purposes They printed a leaflet which began We lament over the death of Lieutenant General Terick CinC of Allied Force in Tarakan and later included the question what do you think of the death in action of your Commander in Chief 31 This leaflet reached few Australian soldiers and had little impact on them Tokyo Rose also broadcast taunts over Terick s death 32 Derrick s reputation continued to grow after his death and many Australian soldiers recalled any association however slight they had with him 31 To many Australians he embodied the ANZAC spirit 47 and he remains perhaps the best known Australian soldier of the Second World War 26 Historian Michael McKernan later remarked that for his war service Derrick had arguably deserved a VC and two bars at El Alamein at Sattelberg and now at Tarakan 35 In a 2004 television interview then Chief of the Australian Defence Force General Peter Cosgrove was asked Who was the best soldier of all time After a short pause he replied Diver Derrick This sentiment was endorsed by General Sir Francis Hassett Hassett who as a lieutenant colonel had served at Finschhafen with II Corps headquarters stated 48 From what I learnt not only was Derrick a magnificent soldier but also a splendid leader who immediately he saw a tactical problem fixed it with either personal bravery or leadership imbued with determination and common sense Derrick is also remembered for his personal qualities He was sensitive and reflective Despite a limited education he was a forceful and logical debater with a thirst for knowledge 32 Derrick kept a diary composed poetry collected butterflies and frequently wrote to his wife while on active service 33 Historian Peter Stanley has compared Derrick s leadership abilities with those of Edward Weary Dunlop Ralph Honner and Roden Cutler 32 On 7 May 1947 Beryl Derrick attended an investiture ceremony at the Government House Adelaide where she was presented with her late husband s Victoria Cross and Distinguished Conduct Medal by the Governor of South Australia Lieutenant General Sir Charles Norrie 13 22 Derrick s Victoria Cross and other medals are now displayed at the Australian War Memorial Canberra 49 along with a portrait by Sir Ivor Hele 1 A street in the neighbouring suburb of Campbell and a rest stop in the Remembrance Driveway between Sydney and Canberra were also named in his honour 50 51 In 1995 a public park was named the Derrick Memorial Reserve on Carlisle St Glanville in his honour and his VC citation is displayed on a plaque there 52 In June 2008 a newly built bridge over the Port River on the Port River Expressway was named the Tom Diver Derrick Bridge following a public campaign 53
