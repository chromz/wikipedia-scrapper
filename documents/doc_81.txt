sponsored that year by the Royal Australian Air Force RAAF which did not at that stage have its own officer training college Budgetary constraints imposed by the Great Depression necessitated the transfer of these cadets out of Duntroon midway through their four year course 4 5 Although offered positions in the Australian Public Service or nominations for short term commissions with the Royal Air Force all were determined to serve with the RAAF apparently delighted at the prospect of entering their chosen service early 4 Enlisting in the Air Force on 10 December 1930 McLachlan completed his flight training the following year 4 6 He was commissioned as a pilot in 1932 and undertook various flight instruction and general duties roles over the next five years 3 In 1937 he was a member

India No 3 Squadron arrived at Suez Egypt in late August 1940 9 10 In its original army cooperation role supporting the Australian 6th Division in the North African Campaign the squadron was equipped with obsolescent Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters and Westland Lysander observation aircraft 9 As part of his unit s work up for operations McLachlan organised training exercises with the 6th Division as well as written exams to test his men s knowledge of army jargon and air to ground communications 11 Described by historian Alan Stephens as acerbic but capable McLachlan led No 3 Squadron through the Battle of Sidi Barrani in December 1940 followed by the Battle of Bardia and the capture of Tobruk in January 1941 9 Prior to converting to Hawker Hurricanes that month the unit was credited with destroying twelve Italian aircraft for the loss of five Gladiators and two pilots McLachlan shot down a Fiat CR 42 on 10 December 1940 the same action in which fellow squadron member and future ace Gordon Steege claimed his first kill 12 Air Officer Commanding in Chief RAF Middle East Air Marshal Sir Arthur Longmore praised McLachlan and his squadron for their high morale and adaptability to desert conditions 13 McLachlan was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross DFC for his fine qualities as a fighter pilot and determined leadership in the face of often overwhelming numbers of enemy aircraft the citation was promulgated in the London Gazette on 11 February 1941 under the name Ian Duncan MacLachlan 14 15 He was the first RAAF fighter pilot to be decorated in World War II 16 17 Promoted to wing commander he took charge of the newly established RAF Benina Benghazi on 13 February handing over No 3 Squadron to Squadron Leader Peter Jeffrey 18 By May 1941 McLachlan was acting as RAAF Liaison Officer for the new Air Officer Commanding in Chief RAF Middle East Air Marshal Arthur Tedder The Air Board in Melbourne chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett was not consulted over this change of role and took exception to the RAF s unilateral action in appointing McLachlan but eventually acquiesced and permitted him to remain at the post to coordinate facilities for RAAF personnel in the region until July when he was recalled to Australia 19 20 In 1942 McLachlan took command of RAAF Station Canberra and later in the year RAAF Station Laverton Victoria 7 Posted for action in New Guinea he became the inaugural commander of No 71 Wing at Milne Bay in February 1943 21 22 The wing consisted of No 6 Squadron flying Lockheed Hudsons No 75 Squadron P 40 Kittyhawks No 77 Squadron Kittyhawks and No 100 Squadron Bristol Beauforts It came under the control of No 9 Operational Group the RAAF s premier fighting unit in the South West Pacific Area SWPA whose purpose was to act as a mobile strike force in support of advancing Allied troops 22 23 In March the Beauforts took part in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea the decisive aerial engagement in the SWPA according to General Douglas MacArthur though they were unable to score any hits against Japanese ships 24 25 By June 1943 McLachlan had been promoted group captain and given command of No 73 Wing He established his headquarters at Goodenough Island where he was responsible for organising the wing into a fighter formation consisting of No 76 Squadron Kittyhawks No 77 Squadron Kittyhawks and No 79 Squadron Spitfires As well as providing local air defence and fighter escort for Australian bombers the Kittyhawks were armed with incendiary and general purpose bombs so that they could engage in ground attack missions a practice that had already been employed by Commonwealth forces in the Middle Eastern theatre 26 In August the wing transferred to Kiriwina while No 9 Group s other combat formation No 71 Wing took over responsibility for Goodenough 27 28 Appointed senior air staff officer SASO at No 9 Group McLachlan handed over command of No 73 Wing to Wing Commander Gordon Steege in October 1943 3 29 Towards the end of his posting to No 9 Group McLachlan told its former commander Air Commodore Joe Hewitt that the USAAF was leaping ahead of the RAAF which was being left to clean up the remnants of Japanese resistance He feared that Australian fighter pilots especially would be increasingly restless if the Americans took all the fighting plums Barely a year later morale among senior RAAF fighter pilots had dropped to such an extent that eight of them tried to resign their commissions in the so called Morotai Mutiny 30 In March 1944 McLachlan took charge of Southern Area Command Melbourne with responsibility for maritime patrol convoy escort and anti submarine warfare in southern Australian waters he handed over to Group Captain Charles Eaton the following January 31 32 Mentioned in despatches on 9 March 1945 for his gallant and distinguished service 33 34 McLachlan returned to action in the South West Pacific as commander of No 81 Wing which comprised Nos 76 77 and 82 Squadrons operating Kittyhawks 7 35 As part of the Australian First Tactical Air Force in the Dutch East Indies the wing was slated to take part in Operation Oboe One the Battle of Tarakan in May but was unable to relocate from Noemfoor to its new base on Morotai in time It fought in Operation Oboe Six the invasion of Labuan from June and was based on the island when the Pacific War ended in August 1945 36 37 Following the end of hostilities McLachlan volunteered to serve with the Allied occupation forces in Japan 38 He married Margaret Helen Chrystal on 5 January 1946 they had a son and a daughter 1 39 Promoted to acting air commodore on 1 March he was appointed SASO of the British Commonwealth Air Group BCAIR headquartered in Kure and responsible for No 81 Wing RAAF as well as squadrons from the Royal Air Force Royal New Zealand Air Force and Indian Air Force 7 40 Returning to Australia in 1948 he served as Air Commodore Operations at RAAF Headquarters Melbourne at which time the English Electric Canberra was ordered as Australia s first jet bomber partly for its ability to deliver nuclear weapons 41 42 He completed his term in September 1951 and took over North Eastern Area Command based at Townsville Queensland 43 Following his appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 New Year s Honours 44 McLachlan was posted to Britain for three years first attending the Imperial Defence College London and then serving as RAF Director of Flying Training at the Air Ministry during 1955 56 Raised to air vice marshal he returned to Australia in 1957 to become Air Officer Commanding AOC Training Command in Melbourne 3 As AOC Training Command McLachlan undertook two reviews that would have according to the official history of the post war RAAF a significant effect on the Air Force of the 1960s 45 In 1957 at the instigation of the Air Member for Personnel Air Vice Marshal Frederick Scherger McLachlan formed a committee to review the effectiveness of the syllabus at RAAF College for meeting the future needs of the Air Force in an age of guided missiles and nuclear weaponry This led to a policy of cadets undertaking academic degrees in line with similar institutions in the other armed services the college was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy The official history of the RAAF considered the result to be only partially successful while it turned out highly educated officers they were educated solely in a rigid scientific discipline suited to an Air Force that never came into existence one relying on missiles rather than manned aircraft 46 In 1959 McLachlan chaired a committee to review the change in the RAAF s command structure that had taken place in 1953 54 from a geographically based area system to a functional system consisting of Home Maintenance Command and Training Commands Concluding that this had reduced duplication and improved efficiency he proposed further rationalisation by amalgamating Training and Maintenance Commands to form a new organisation Support Command His plan was duly implemented as was his recommendation that Home Command responsible for air operations be renamed Operational Command 45 McLachlan was appointed Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1959 before being posted to Washington DC as attaché heading up the Australian Joint Services Staff in 1961 3 During his term in the US Australia ordered the General Dynamics F 111C swing wing bomber as a replacement for the Canberra Despite what was touted as a firm timetable and cost schedule for the order McLachlan confided to a colleague that he had serious concerns about when and if the RAAF would actually get the F 111 and what the final cost would be According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens even for such a shrewd and sardonic man as McLachlan that was to prove a painfully prescient observation as the new bomber was delivered six years late and massively over budget 47 Following his return from Washington McLachlan became Air Member for Supply and Equipment AMSE in February 1964 48 As AMSE he sat on the Air Board the service s controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff In this position he worked to increase the proportion of tertiary educated supply officers following similar achievements among engineering officers in the RAAF s Technical Branch 49 He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1966 New Year s Honours the citation noting particularly his chairmanship of the two historic committees that reorganised RAAF College and the Air Force s command structure in the late 1950s 50 51 The use of electronic data processing became more widespread during McLachlan s tenure as AMSE and by 1968 the RAAF s supply system had been computerised 52 McLachlan completed his term as Air Member for Supply and Equipment on 23 July 1968 and retired from the RAAF he was divorced from his wife the same year 1 6 Upon leaving the military he became an aeronautical consultant to the Northrop Corporation and chairman of Information Electronics Pty Ltd from 1983 serving in both positions until 1987 1 3 He was also chairman of Pokolbin Winemakers from 1970 through 1975 1 In retirement he continued to exercise his interest in Australia s defence joining in 1975 a group of pundits including former Chief of the Air Staff Sir Alister Murdoch who promoted the addition of nuclear weapons to the country s arsenal 53 A resident of Sydney s Darling Point Ian McLachlan died on
