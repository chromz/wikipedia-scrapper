Korean War Reginald Walter Reg Saunders MBE 7 August 1920 2 March 1990 was the first Aboriginal Australian to be commissioned as an officer in the Australian Army He came from a military family his

lieutenant and serving as a platoon commander in New Guinea during 1944 1945 His younger brother Harry also joined the Army and was killed in 1942 during the Kokoda Track campaign After the war Saunders was demobilised and returned to civilian life He later served as a company commander with the 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment 3 RAR during the Korean War where he fought at the Battle of Kapyong Saunders left the Army in 1954 and worked in the logging and metal industries before joining the Office of Aboriginal Affairs later the Department of Aboriginal Affairs as a liaison officer in 1969 In 1971 he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire MBE for his community service He died in 1990 aged 69 Saunders was born near Purnim on the Aboriginal Reserve at Framlingham in western Victoria on 7 August 1920 1 He was a member of the Gunditjmara people 2 His father Chris was a veteran of the First World War having served as a machine gunner in the Australian Imperial Force 3 4 One of his uncles William Reginald Rawlings who was killed in action and after whom Saunders was named 5 had been awarded the Military Medal for service with the 29th Battalion in France 6 7 Another ancestor John Brook fought with the Victorian Rifles and the Australian Commonwealth Horse in the Boer War 8 Saunders mother died in 1924 from complications caused by pneumonia while giving birth to her third child a girl who also died 9 After this his father moved to Lake Condah in Victoria 10 with Reg and his younger brother Harry born in 1922 11 As their father undertook various labouring jobs the two boys were raised largely by their grandmother 1 Saunders attended the local mission school at Lake Condah where he did well in maths geometry and languages His father meanwhile taught Reg and Harry about the bush and encouraged them to read Shakespeare and Australian literature After completing eight years of schooling Saunders earned his merit certificate 12 His formal education thus ended he went to work at the age of 14 as a millhand in a sawmill 9 13 Employers regularly withheld payments for Aboriginal labourers at this time but Saunders refused to work unless he was paid his full entitlement and his employer relented 13 He worked and furthered his education until 1937 when he went into business with his father and brother operating a sawmill in Portland Victoria the sawmill was destroyed in a bushfire in 1939 11 13 Following the outbreak of the Second World War Saunders was determined to serve in the armed forces Patriotism and his family s history of soldiering both played a major part in his decision His father suggested that he wait six months according to Reg They were talking about this war being all over in six months with the Maginot Line and all the other garbage that we were told But we waited six months and the duck season was over so there was no more shooting to do except go to war 14 Saunders enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force on 24 April 1940 1 15 joining up with friends he had made while playing Australian rules football 11 The armed forces later adopted a policy to accept only persons substantially of European origin or descent but at the time Saunders encountered no barriers to his enlistment 16 He recalled that his fellow soldiers were not colour conscious and that during training in northern Queensland his white mates would sit alongside him in the Aboriginal section of movie theatres 17 His natural leadership qualities gained him temporary promotions in quick succession within six weeks of enlistment he was a lance corporal and after three months he made sergeant 9 18 After completing his training Saunders was allocated to an infantry unit the 2 7th Battalion which was serving overseas in North Africa at the time 19 Upon reaching the 2 7th Saunders reverted to the rank of private 18 20 His first experience of war came fighting the Italians around Benghazi 6 20 In early April 1941 the 6th Division to which the 2 7th belonged was sent to Greece to help defend against a German invasion 19 Following a series of withdrawals the battalion was evacuated on 26 April embarking upon the Costa Rica at Kalamata 20 It was originally bound for Alexandria 21 but after the ship was attacked in Suda Bay by German aircraft and began to sink the men of the 2 7th including Saunders 20 were picked up by several British destroyers and disembarked on the island of Crete The 2 7th was subsequently allocated to the island s defending garrison 19 Following the invasion of Crete in May 1941 the 2 7th Battalion was initially employed in a coastal defence role before taking part in the fighting around Canea After this it took part in a devastating bayonet charge at 42nd Street along with the New Zealand Maori Battalion which killed almost 300 Germans and briefly checked their advance 19 22 It was during this battle that Saunders killed his first opponent 23 I saw a German soldier stand up in clear view about thirty yards 30 m away He was my first sure kill I can remember for a moment that it was just like shooting a kangaroo just as remote 24 As the Allies began to evacuate the island the 2 7th was called upon to carry out a series of rearguard actions in order to allow other units to be taken off the island After the final Allied ships departed the island on 1 June 1941 the battalion was left behind 19 As a result many of its men were taken prisoner though some were able to evade capture by hiding out in the hills and caves around the island Adopting Cretan dress learning the dialect and enlisting the help of local inhabitants Saunders managed to remain hidden for eleven months 25 26 Saunders was among a party of men evacuated from Crete by a British submarine in May 1942 and returned to Australia in October 2 26 He rejoined his old unit the 2 7th Battalion which had re formed in Palestine and been brought back to Australia along with the rest of the 6th Division to help defend against the threat posed by Japan s entry into the war 19 In November 1942 Saunders younger brother Harry who had enlisted shortly after him in 1940 was killed in action while serving in New Guinea with the 2 14th Battalion 1 6 28 When Harry had joined up Reg recalled I was angry because I was the only one that was supposed to go with two of us there one of us was going to get killed 29 The elder Saunders subsequently served in New Guinea as well fighting in the Salamaua Lae campaign in mid 1943 where having again been promoted temporary sergeant he took over command of a platoon when its commander was wounded in action For his leadership he was recommended for a commission by his commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Henry Guinn 9 30 When Guinn told him of his plan Saunders laughed and said I don t want to be an officer I d rather be Regimental Sergeant Major Guinn responded Christ they don t make boys RSMs 31 Saunders went before an officer selection board that had been set up on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland where the units of the 6th Division had been based following their return from New Guinea The interview panel on the board consisted of three senior officers all experienced infantry battalion commanders who were tasked with determining a candidate s suitability for commissioning as an infantry officer 32 Saunders was found to be an acceptable candidate and posted to an officer training unit in Seymour Victoria 6 Upon completion of the 16 week course he was promoted to lieutenant in November 1944 becoming the first Aboriginal commissioned officer in the Australian Army 1 33 The precedent of his commissioning had caused the Army some concern due to its special significance and as a result the paperwork for its confirmation was eventually sent to the Commander in Chief General Sir Thomas Blamey for approval 34 Nevertheless Blamey is reported to have insisted upon following the usual procedure believing that there should be no difference in the way Saunders commission should be treated to any other soldier who had completed the necessary training 9 The story garnered much press coverage in Australia most of it favourable if in parts paternalistic 35 After his promotion was confirmed Saunders returned to New Guinea and although it was contrary to policy rejoined his old battalion He subsequently took part in the Aitape Wewak campaign commanding a platoon until the end of the war 36 Due to the discriminatory laws in force at the time Saunders had fewer rights as a citizen than the white Australians he led 37 He was wounded in the knee by Japanese gunfire during fighting around Maprik and was hospitalised for three weeks as a result 38 39 Saunders was discharged from the Army on 5 October 1945 following the end of the Second World War 15 Returning to Australia he volunteered for service in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force but the government would not accept Aborigines for the operation 34 Saunders spoke publicly against this policy calling it narrow minded and ignorant 40 the wartime restriction on non European enlistments in the armed forces was not lifted until 1949 41 Saunders moved to Melbourne with his family which by this time consisted of his wife Dorothy whom he had married in 1944 and their three young children 42 Dorothy had served in the Women s Auxiliary Australian Air Force during the war 41 43 Saunders recalled that he had a hard time after the war and poor old Dotty she you know didn t know what the hell to make of it 44 Facing discrimination that he had rarely encountered as a soldier he worked in the ensuing years as a tram conductor a foundry worker and a shipping clerk 42 45 In August 1950 the government called for Second World War veterans to serve in the Korea War as part of the specially raised K Force Saunders volunteered and returned to the Army as a lieutenant 1 46 After training at Puckapunyal Victoria and in Japan 42 he arrived in Korea in November 1950 He served with the 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment 3 RAR initially as a platoon commander in A Company In February 1951 he took charge of A Company when its commander was wounded he was subsequently given command of C Company 46 Promoted to captain Saunders led C Company during the Battle of Kapyong in April when 3 RAR and a Canadian battalion held off a Chinese division north east of the South Korean capital Seoul 47 48 Frustrated by the conduct of the war prior to Kapyong he afterwards recorded that At last I felt like an Anzac and I imagine there were 600 others like me 49 The 3rd Battalion was awarded a US Presidential Unit Citation for its part in the action Saunders himself was recommended for a decoration but turned it down 6 50 Leading a Vickers machine gun platoon at the Battle of Maryang San in October he reportedly shared the following exchange with a fellow 3 RAR officer as they surveyed the forbidding mountain before them Saunders companion remarked No country for white men to which Saunders replied It s no country for black men either 51 He returned to Australia in November 1951 52 In 1953 the Returned and Services League RSL a veterans organisation recommended Saunders for inclusion in the official Australian contingent to the coronation of Elizabeth II the Federal government rejected the suggestion on the grounds that including Saunders would have meant excluding an officer who had been previously selected 53 54 Following his service in the Korean War Saunders remained in the Army overseeing training for national servicemen at Puckapunyal Away from active service however he soon became dissatisfied and in 1954 was discharged at his own request 1 34 The same year he married an Irish nurse Pat Montgomery his first marriage had broken down soon after he returned from Korea 55 Saunders went to work in the logging industry in Gippsland after which he moved to Sydney where he was employed by the Austral Bronze Company 1 Seen by many as a role model and spokesman for Aboriginal Australians in 1969 Saunders took up a position in the Office of Aboriginal Affairs as one of its first liaison officers 36 37 Among his tasks was promulgating information on recently legislated Federal funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses and schooling following up on recommendations made to government departments and liaising with Aboriginal welfare groups 56 He later stated I felt a sense of leadership of Aboriginal people and a desire to do something about the Aboriginal situation 57 His community work was recognised in the Queen s Birthday Honours of June 1971 when he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire MBE in the Civil Division 58 59 He continued to serve with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra until retiring in 1980 60 In July 1985 he was appointed to the Council of the Australian War Memorial and held this position until his retirement 37 61 He was also involved in the RSL though he fell out with leaders Alf Garland and Bruce Ruxton over Garland s suggestion that Aborigines be blood tested to determine their entitlement to government benefits They can take all the blood they want from me Saunders declared in a 1986 interview and they ll never find out what I am least of all an Aborigine bloody stupid 62 During his two marriages both of which ended in divorce Saunders fathered ten children two of whom predeceased him 1 Having suffered recent heart trouble 63 64 he died on 2 March 1990 1 His ashes were scattered on Lake Condah traditional territory of the Gunditjmara people 64 65 Of Saunders children one of his sons followed him into the Army while four of his daughters married soldiers 5 His son Christopher portrayed him in a 1978 episode of the television series The Sullivans 66 On 14 December 2001 Saunders was honoured with the dedication of Reg Saunders Way which passes through the Canberra suburbs of Campbell and Russell in a ceremony attended by the Secretary of the Department of Defence Dr Allan Hawke and the Chief of the Defence Force Admiral Chris Barrie
