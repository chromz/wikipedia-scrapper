officer in this role as brusque and impersonal though not unsympathetic his uncommunicative manner stemming from a preference to do his own research think out the substance of his project submissions dictate to his stenographer then amend to his own satisfaction rather than delegate 22 Hannah served as Air Officer Commanding AOC Operational Command now Air Command from February 1965 to December

the Air Staff 1 5 Murdoch had earlier recommended Hannah known to be a strong advocate for Australian participation in the Vietnam War for the position of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam when it came up for rotation at the end of 1969 the post went to an Army officer and the Federal government ordered the withdrawal of the RAAF presence in Vietnam during Hannah s tour as CAS 29 In March 1970 the Minister for Defence Malcolm Fraser commissioned a review of naval air power Hannah fundamentally disagreed with any suggestion that the Royal Australian Navy should operate land based aircraft claiming that he was arguing not from a partisan perspective but to ensure that Australia s limited defence resources were not spread across three services Confidential RAAF papers from the time declared that its goal was always to avoid giving the Navy the opportunity to establish a land based air force 30 Two years later Hannah responded favourably to a recommendation from the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee Admiral Sir Victor Smith to use the soon to be delivered F 111 bomber for maritime support among other roles 31 In the 1971 New Year Honours Hannah was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire KBE 32 His tour as CAS coincided with the RAAF s Golden Jubilee celebrated in March and April that year He personally organised a fly past of two US Air Force F 111s at air shows marking the occasion generating favourable coverage to counteract the poor publicity surrounding the type s long delayed entry into Australian service 33 He was also involved in two controversial decisions the same year Firstly he was a member of the committee to choose an Air Force memorial to be located on Anzac Parade Canberra The selected design was an abstract sculpture that according to official RAAF historian Alan Stephens reflected the selection panel s comprehensive failure to understand the nature of air force service 27 Secondly Hannah commissioned a replacement for the Air Force s winter uniform traditionally a shade somewhere between royal and navy blue that had been personally chosen by the RAAF s first CAS Wing Commander later Air Marshal Sir Richard Williams to distinguish it from the lighter Royal Air Force colour 27 Hannah publicly debuted the uniform that he approved an all purpose middle blue suit at a Point Cook graduation parade on 8 December 1971 34 35 It was the object of much adverse comment in the ensuing years personnel complained of being mistaken for bus train and postal employees One of Hannah s successors as CAS Air Marshal Errol McCormack ordered that the uniform revert to Williams original colour and style commencing in 2000 35 Hannah s planned three year term as Chief of the Air Staff was cut short by some ten months when he accepted an offer to serve as Governor of Queensland becoming the first officer in the RAAF to receive a vice regal appointment The announcement was made in January 1972 and he took office on 21 March 1 36 He succeeded Sir Alan Mansfield 37 Hannah did not have a strong connection with Queensland at the time of his appointment and had only lived in the state during his period as commander of RAAF Station Amberley between 1949 and 1951 38 He claimed not to have actively sought the governorship and was criticised for failing to consult with senior colleagues before making his decision to retire early from his position as head of the Air Force He was replaced as CAS by his deputy Air Vice Marshal later Air Marshal Sir Charles Read 39 40 Described when he took office as a man with the flexibility of mind and ability to mix with people so necessary for a Governor 1 Hannah was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George KCMG and a Knight and Deputy Prior of the Venerable Order of Saint John in September 1972 41 42 His term as Governor was relatively uneventful until 1975 In October that year he created controversy at a Brisbane Chamber of Commerce luncheon by criticising the fumbling ineptitude of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam s Federal Labor government for placing Australia in its present economic state 1 40 Vice regal appointees in Australia were expected to remain above politics but Hannah declared that he would be guilty of sheltering behind convention of denying my heritage and failing in my regard for the people of Queensland if he did not speak his mind 43 The incident occurred in the midst of a constitutional crisis and according to military historian Chris Coulthard Clark was widely seen as a blatant intervention in the national political arena 44 The Federal government responded by advising the Queen to revoke Hannah s dormant commission to serve in place of the Governor General if required at the time Hannah was the second in line to serve as Governor General after the Governor of New South Wales 44 Following his succession in November 1975 Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser attempted to have the dormant commission reinstated but the Queen apparently following advice from the British government that cited Hannah s lack of impartiality refused her assent When Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke Petersen sought to extend the Governor s term the British government again declined When Bjelke Petersen sought to pursue the matter further Hannah declined to let his name be put forward again 40 45 On 9 October 1976 Hannah dedicated a memorial at Cairns to commemorate the crews of RAAF Catalina flying boats who lost their lives in the South West Pacific during World War II 46 His vice regal appointment lapsed on 20 March 1977 and he was succeeded the next month by Commodore Sir James Ramsay 7 37 Hannah retired following completion of his term as Governor of Queensland 7 He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order KCVO in August 1977 backdated to March as part of Queen Elizabeth II s Silver Jubilee visit to Australia 47 Hannah died of a heart attack on 22 May 1978 at his home in Surfers Paradise Queensland He was given a state funeral and cremated his wife and daughter survived him 1 Hannah Community Park straddling the suburbs of Fadden and Gowrie in Canberra was established in his honour in 2002 48
