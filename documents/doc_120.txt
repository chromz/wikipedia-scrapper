women to be homemakers thus they rarely left the home to earn an income As such women were discouraged from joining the military Only a small number of Hispanic women joined the military before World War II 5 However with the outbreak of World War II cultural prohibitions began to change With the creation of the Women s Army Auxiliary Corps WAAC predecessor of the Women s Army Corps WAC and the U

however they were not accepted into the Army Nurse Corps or Navy Nurse Corps As a result many women went to work in the factories which produced military equipment As more Hispanic men joined the armed forces a need for bilingual nurses became apparent and the Army started to recruit Hispanic nurses In 1944 the Army Nurse Corps ANC decided to accept Puerto Rican nurses Thirteen women submitted applications were interviewed underwent physical examinations and were accepted into the ANC Eight of these nurses were assigned to the Army Post at San Juan Puerto Rico where they were valued for

Shortly thereafter he was given command of the XII Fighter Command and in this capacity would work out the mechanics of close air support and Army Air Force cooperation 71 The successful integration
