new government was formed under the commander of the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force Armijski đeneral Dušan Simović 6 It included members who fell into three groups those who were strongly opposed to the Axis and prepared to face war with Germany those who advocated peace with Germany and those that were uncommitted 7 8 The first group included Petrović who urged an immediate general mobilisation 9 This was not initiated by the new government until 3 April 1941 out of fear of offending Hitler and thus precipitating war 10 However on the same day as the coup Hitler issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state and on 3 April issued Führer Directive 26 detailing the plan of attack and command structure for a German led Axis invasion which was to commence on 6 April 11 Petrović was appointed to command the 1st Army Group prior to the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia 12 13 His command consisted of the 4th Army of Armijski đeneral Petar Nedeljković

the defence of the northwestern border with Italy and Germany Petrović s army group reserve consisting of the 1st Cavalry Division was located around and to the south of Zagreb 16 The Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić describes the mobilisation of all formations of the 1st Army Group on 6 April as only partial and notes that there was a limited response to mobilisation of both men and animals 17 On the first day of their invasion of Yugoslavia the Germans seized bridges over the Drava river in both armies sectors and several mountain passes in the 7th Army sector 18 19 20 In the 4th Army sector the formation and expansion of German bridgeheads across the Drava were facilitated by fifth column elements of the Croatian nationalist Ustaše Revolts of Croat soldiers broke out in all three divisions of the 4th Army in the first few days causing significant disruption to mobilisation and deployment The rest of 1st Army Group was also weakened by fifth column activities within its major units and Petrović s chief of staff and chief of operations aided both Ustaše and Slovene separatists in the 4th and 7th Army sectors respectively 21 The revolts within the 4th Army were of great concern to Trifunović due to the danger to his right flank but Petrović did not permit him to withdraw from border areas until the night of 7 8 April which was followed by the German capture of Maribor as they continued to expand their bridgeheads 22 The 4th Army also began to withdraw southwards on 9 April and on 10 April it quickly ceased to exist as an operational formation in the face of two determined armoured thrusts by the XXXXVI Motorised Corps one of which captured Zagreb that evening 23 Italian offensive operations also began with thrusts towards Ljubljana and down the Adriatic coast capturing over 30 000 Yugoslav troops near Delnice When fifth columnists arrested Petrović and the staffs of 1st Army Group 4th Army and 7th Army on 11 April the 1st Army Group effectively ceased to exist On 12 April a German armoured column linked up with the Italians near the Adriatic coast encircling the remnants of the withdrawing 7th Army Remnants of the 4th Army attempted to establish defensive positions in northeastern Bosnia but were quickly brushed aside by German armoured units as they drove towards Sarajevo The Yugoslav Supreme Command unconditionally surrendered on 18 April 24 25 The Ustaše quickly handed Petrović over to the Germans who sent him to a prisoner of war camp in Germany He remained there for the rest of the war 2 At the end of the war Petrović was liberated from internment in Germany and given the option of returning to the new communist led Federal People s Republic of Yugoslavia which had replaced the Kingdom of Yugoslavia following the victory of the Yugoslav Partisans in 1945 In July 1946 Petrović opted to return to Yugoslavia He was the lifelong president of a veterans association for those who had participated in the Royal Serbian Army s 1915 withdrawal to Corfu 2 He also published a two volume work about the withdrawal entitled Across Albania 26 In the early 1960s Petrović became acquainted with the journalist David Binder who was stationed as a New York Times foreign correspondent in Belgrade The two met through Petrović s daughter Mirjana who was working as Binder s secretary and became close friends Despite
