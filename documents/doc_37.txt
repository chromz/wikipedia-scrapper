the division to the Middle East where on arriving in December he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and posted as senior liaison officer to I Corps 3 During this time the Australian 6th Division and I Corps Headquarters were diverted for service in the Greek Campaign 4 Wells arrived in Greece on 7 March 1941 with an advance party of Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey s I Corps staff 4 On 10 April a plan was formulated to withdraw Greek and Commonwealth troops from their positions in the Verria pass of the Vermion Mountains to the River Aliakmon To carry this out Blamey despatched Wells to coordinate the movement of the 12th Greek Division west to its new position 5 6 The withdrawal began on 12 April but the force s movement was hampered because of lack of vehicles and the division did not arrive until late evening the following day 7 During this time Wells travelled between I Corps Headquarters and the 12th Greek Division organising and coordinating the division s movement despite

services during this time 12 Wells was additionally Mentioned in Despatches 13 Following Greece the headquarters of I Corps returned to Palestine 14 Wells was made General Staff Officer 2nd Grade GSO2 3 the deputy chief of staff in charge of planning operations 15 I Corps was alerted to take part in the Syria Lebanon Campaign in spite of the fact that since Blamey had been promoted to Deputy Commander in Chief Middle East Command the corps lacked a commanding officer General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson the British commander in Palestine and Transjordan believed that I Corps loss of transport and signal equipment precluded it from participating in the campaign from the outset 16 Instead Wilson attempted to exercise command from the King David Hotel This proved to be a serious error as his staff were preoccupied with political and administrative issues and were too remote from the battlefields to exercise the close command required 17 Following a series of reverses I Corps headquarters was sent for on 18 June and Lieutenant General John Lavarack assumed command that day The headquarters was confronted by a difficult situation with almost all reserves committed Lavarack began regrouping his force concentrating the 7th Division for a decisive thrust towards Beirut Hard fighting was required before the campaign was brought to a successful conclusion 18 Promoted to colonel Wells became General Staff Officer 1st Grade GSO1 to the 9th Division in November 1941 3 As such he was the 9th Division s chief of staff responsible for the full range of staff activities 19 On 28 June 1942 Wells accompanied Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead Commander of the 9th Division to Cairo where they received orders tasking the 9th Division with the defence of Cairo The pair

dispatched to Alexandria the move took place on 1 July 20 Two days later it was decided that the 24th Infantry Brigade would be sent forward to reinforce the position at El Alamein The brigade was lacking in equipment and Wells spent that day arranging equipment for the unit as well as overseeing its preparation the brigade moved forward the next day 21 The divisional headquarters proceeded to El Alamein on 7 July and was posted to the northern flank of the British front line The unit then spent the remainder of the month in action against Axis forces in the area 22 For his distinguished services during this period Wells was Mentioned in Despatches a second time 23 On 23 October 1942 the British and Commonwealth forces under Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery launched an offensive against Axis forces at El Alamein The 9th Division took part in the battle and was initially tasked with the seizure of a section of the Oxalic Line 24 Over the proceeding twelve days the Australians heavily contributed to the assault with Morshead and his staff coordinating the 9th Division s operations success was claimed on 4 November 25 Praised for his ability of high order 26 Wells was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his efforts in training and preparing the division before the battle in addition to his labours during the engagement 27 The notification for the decoration was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 11 February 1943 28 In late November 1942 the members of the 9th Division returned to Palestine 29 In January the unit embarked from North Africa and sailed home to Australia in preparation for service against the Japanese in the South West Pacific 30 Wells arrived back in Australia during February 1943 3 On 15 March Morshead was appointed to

of the corps undertook training in both jungle and amphibious warfare in preparation for its planned deployment to New Guinea 32 Wells took an active hand in organising these exercises 33 before he moved with the corps headquarters to New Guinea during October 34 The movement of II Corps coincided with the vicious fighting around the Huon Peninsula and Finisterre Range 35 Wells assisted in the planning and coordination of operations over the subsequent months which culminated in the seizure of Madang during April 1944 Wells was awarded his third Mention in Despatches during this time for his exceptional services in the field 36 37 In April 1944 II Corps was redesignated as I Corps and returned to Australia where it established itself on the Atherton Tableland in Queensland 3 38 The following month Wells proceeded to Land Command Headquarters in Sydney where he attended a conference on staff appointments He returned to the corps eleven days later During this period Wells was once again active in organising the unit s training off the Queensland coast 39 before he was granted a period of leave during August he returned to duty on 26 September 40 On 19 July 1945 41 Wells was upgraded to a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his exceptional ability and outstanding devotion to duty in conjunction with the valuable assistance given throughout the New Guinea campaign to the General Officer Commanding New Guinea Force 3 42 43 During March 1945 Wells acted as one of the eight pallbearers for Major General George Alan Vasey at the latter s funeral Vasey had been killed in a plane crash just off the coast of Cairns while en route to assume command of the 6th Division in New Guinea 44 That same month it was decided that I Corps would lead an assault

general 3 In June of that year Wells acted as one of the ten pallbearers to Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey at his state funeral in Melbourne 49 Wells was appointed Commander in Chief British Commonwealth Forces Korea in 1953 Assuming the role on 11 February he led the Commonwealth contingent for the next twenty one months as the Korean War was coming to an end 3 50 Like his predecessors in the position Wells exercised administrative command only and had no direct control over battlefield operations Though its incumbents were considered to have performed well the role garnered little credit for helping facilitate combat success but was a soft target for criticism when operations did not run smoothly 51 Wells had been sent to Korea with no instructions regarding the withdrawal of troops and as armistice talks appeared on the verge of success he was closely involved in liaison with the heads of Commonwealth governments regarding General Mark Clark s requests for their commitment to retain forces in the theatre for some period following the end of hostilities 52 Raised to substantive lieutenant general on 12 April 1954 3 Wells was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the Queen s Birthday Honours that June 53 He was commended for his exceptional meritorious service in Korea 54 and awarded the United States Legion of Merit in the degree of Commander

formation of the first regular brigade group 3 He was upgraded to a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1956 New Years Honours 56 On 23 March 1958 Wells was appointed the first Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee COSC the professional head of the Australian Military 57 The position had previously existed as an extension to the responsibilities of the senior service chief either the Chief of Naval Staff Chief of the General Staff or Chief of the Air Staff but Wells was the first to occupy the position as a separate post The chairmanship of COSC was created as part of the Australian government s response to a review of the Defence group of departments conducted by Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead in 1957 which recommended greater centralisation of the armed forces Although the Chairman was the Government s principal military advisor and reported directly to the Minister for Defence Wells was not promoted and remained at the same rank as the heads of the Navy Army and Air Force He was also hampered by being given only a small staff The role of the Chairman COSC was not strengthened until 1965 when Air Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger who had been appointed to the position in 1961 was promoted to air chief marshal so that he out ranked the service heads 58 Wells served in this capacity until his retirement from the Australian military on 22 March 1959 3 57 In retirement Wells was appointed as a director to several companies including Broken Hill South Ltd Metal Manufactures Ltd Navcot Australia Pty Ltd and Sitmar Line Australia Pty Ltd During April 1961 Wells was appointed honorary colonel of the Royal Victoria Regiment Described as somewhat reserved and taciturn during his life 3 Wells died at Yarrawonga Victoria on 20 October 1973 and was survived by his wife and their two sons His funeral service took place with full military honours at Toorak Presbyterian Church after which he was cremated In his will Wells bequeathed a sizable proportion of his estate to Junior Legacy Melbourne 3 Wells Road a street in Duntroon Australian Capital Territory is named in his honour 59
